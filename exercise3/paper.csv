s10084,neutralization-sensitive merozoite surface antigens of babesia bovis encoded by members of a polymorphic gene family.,"neutralization-sensitive merozoite surface antigens of babesia bovis encoded by members of a polymorphic gene family.. Monospecific antibodies against native and recombinant versions of the major merozoite surface antigen (MSA-1) of Babesia bovis neutralize the infectivity of merozoites from Texas and Mexico strains in vitro. Sequence analysis shows that MSA-1 and a related, co-expressed 44 kDa merozoite surface protein (MSA-2) are encoded by members of a multigene family previously designated BabR. BabR genes, originally described in Australia strains of B. bovis, are notable because their marked polymorphism is apparently mediated by chromosomal rearrangements, but protein products of BabR genes have not previously been identified. The 3' terminal 173 nucleotides of the MSA-1 gene, including 60 nucleotides of untranslated sequence, are highly similar to the 3' terminal sequences of BabR 0.8 (84% identity) and MSA-2 (94% identity). Alignment of the predicted protein sequences demonstrates significant overall homology between MSA-1 and MSA-2, and between both proteins and the amino terminal BabR sequence. MSA-1 nucleic acid probes also hybridize weakly to genomic DNA from the Australia 'L' strain, even though this strain does not express merozoite surface epitopes cross-reactive with MSA-1 or MSA-2. Hybridization of these same probes to genomic DNA from the cloned Mexico strain reveals a pattern of bands compatible with two copies each of MSA-1 and MSA-2. Proteins encoded by this B. bovis gene family have been designated variable merozoite surface antigens (VMSA). The extent and mechanism of VMSA polymorphism among strains will be important when evaluating the role these surface proteins have in the host-parasite interaction, including immunity to blood stages.",1992
s10093,signalling through the mhc class ii cytoplasmic domain is required for antigen presentation and induces b7 expression.,"signalling through the mhc class ii cytoplasmic domain is required for antigen presentation and induces b7 expression.. Class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules function as antigen-presenting elements as well as signal transducers on B lymphocytes. We previously reported that a B lymphoma cell transfectant, 5C2, expressing genetically engineered I-Ak molecules with truncated cytoplasmic domains was severely impaired in both antigen presentation and in anti-Ia-induced intracytoplasmic signalling. These two functions could be restored by preculturing 5C2 cells with cyclic AMP analogues. Here we demonstrate that impaired signal transduction by truncated class II molecules results in a deficiency in induction of the newly defined B-cell accessory molecule B7 (ref. 8), which can be reversed by restoration of B7 expression. These data imply that contact of the T-cell antigen receptor with MHC/antigen ligand results in signal transmission through the class II cytoplasmic domain. This signal, which can be mimicked by dibutyryl cAMP, induces expression of B7, resulting in effective antigen presentation. The fact that crosslinking of surface class II MHC also induces B7 expression on normal resting human B cells supports this contention.",1992
s10107,cloning and surface expression of pseudomonas aeruginosa o antigen in escherichia coli.,"cloning and surface expression of pseudomonas aeruginosa o antigen in escherichia coli.. As a step toward developing recombinant oral vaccines, we have explored the feasibility of expression of O polysaccharide antigens from Pseudomonas aeruginosa by Escherichia coli. We cloned in E. coli HB101 a 26.2-kilobase DNA fragment from P. aeruginosa strain PA103 that specifies the production of the O polysaccharide of Fisher immunotype 2 (IT-2) strains. The recombinant organism incorporated the P. aeruginosa IT-2 O polysaccharide onto the core of the E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Transfer of the recombinant plasmid to three LPS-rough strains of P. aeruginosa resulted in synthesis of IT-2 O antigen, and two of these transconjugant strains also synthesized a second O polysaccharide, presumably representing expression of a repressed, or an incomplete, set of genes for an endogenous O polysaccharide. Rabbits injected with the purified recombinant LPS made antibody specific for P. aeruginosa IT-2 O side chains, as did mice fed the recombinant E. coli strain. Expression of P. aeruginosa O antigens by enteric bacteria makes it possible to study these recombinant strains as oral vaccines to prevent P. aeruginosa infections.",1992
s10198,murine b7 antigen provides a sufficient costimulatory signal for antigen-specific and mhc-restricted t cell activation.,"murine b7 antigen provides a sufficient costimulatory signal for antigen-specific and mhc-restricted t cell activation.. We have previously shown that the murine B7 (mB7) molecule, when expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells in stable fashion, can costimulate with anti-CD3 mAb or Con A to induce T cell activation. We have now derived, by gene transfection, Chinese hamster ovary cell lines that express the I-Ad molecule, either alone or in context with mB7. We have analyzed these transfectants for their capacity to present Ag to murine CD4+ T lymphocytes. I-Ad/mB7-double transfectants were able to stimulate mixed lymphocyte reactions and to present peptide Ag to specific T cells. Chinese hamster ovary cells that expressed only the I-Ad molecule were not able to stimulate T cell proliferation in these systems. Thus, the mB7 protein is a sufficient costimulatory molecule for the physiologic, Ag-dependent/MHC-restricted activation of murine CD4+ T cells. Stimulation of T cell bulk cultures resulted predominantly in the production of IL-2 and not of IL-4. The costimulatory activity of mB7 is not, however, restricted to the IL-2-secreting subset. We have identified one IL-4-secreting T cell clone, CDC35, which is responsive to mB7 triggering. Finally, we present experiments that suggest that mB7 and peptide/MHC complexes need to be expressed on the same cell for optimal induction of T cell activation.",1992
s10289,the blood group antigen-related glycoepitopes: key structural determinants in immunogenesis and aids pathogenesis.,"the blood group antigen-related glycoepitopes: key structural determinants in immunogenesis and aids pathogenesis.. This overview will focus on the functional and pathophysiological aspects of blood group antigen (BGA)-related glycodeterminants with regard to immunogenesis and AIDS pathogenesis. It has been postulated that in a broad range of histogenetically different tissues and organs, BGA-related glycoepitopes are expressed on the cell surface at definite stages of cell differentiation. These glycoepitopes are expressed during embryogenesis, organogenesis, tissue repair, regeneration, remodelling and maturation when 'sorting-out' of one homotypic cell population from a heterotypic assemblage of cells occurs (1). In this event, the BGA-related glycoepitopes, if being expressed on the cell surface, play roles of key structural determinants in cell-cell recognition, association and aggregation. This mechanism will be discussed in relation to immunogenesis with regard to antigen presentation, self-non-self discrimination, and positive and negative selection during thymic education. It is postulated that the appearance of BGA-related glycoepitopes on the cell membrane is a consequence of the association of major histocompatibility complex antigens (MHC) and peptides, with the subsequent elimination of cells carrying a high density of BGA-related glycoepitopes on their surface. After human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) glycoproteins are glycosylated by host cell glycosyltransferases, the virus may use the BGA-related glycodeterminants as ligands and/or receptors for expansion to a spectrum of target cells during AIDS development and generalization of the infection throughout the body. We will review the experimental evidence that supports the concept that HIV uses an alternative to the gp120/CD4 ligand/receptor system, and that the alternative mechanism is probably carbohydrate-mediated in nature.",1992
s10545,proteasome subunits encoded by the major histocompatibility complex are not essential for antigen presentation.,"proteasome subunits encoded by the major histocompatibility complex are not essential for antigen presentation.. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules bind and deliver peptides derived from endogenously synthesized proteins to the cell surface for survey by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. It is believed that endogenous antigens are generally degraded in the cytosol, the resulting peptides being translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum where they bind to MHC class I molecules. Transporters containing an ATP-binding cassette encoded by the MHC class II region seem to be responsible for this transport. Genes coding for two subunits of the '20S' proteasome (a multicatalytic proteinase) have been found in the vicinity of the two transporter genes in the MHC class II region, indicating that the proteasome could be the unknown proteolytic entity in the cytosol involved in the generation of MHC class I-binding peptides. By introducing rat genes encoding the MHC-linked transporters into a human cell line lacking both transporter and proteasome subunit genes, we show here that the MHC-encoded proteasome subunit are not essential for stable MHC class I surface expression, or for processing and presentation of antigenic peptides from influenza virus and an intracellular protein.",1992
s10961,involvement of simian virus 40 (sv40) small t antigen in trans activation of sv40 early and late promoters.,"involvement of simian virus 40 (sv40) small t antigen in trans activation of sv40 early and late promoters.. We have previously found that simian virus 40 (SV40) small t antigen (small t) can trans activate the E2A and VA-I genes of adenovirus in plasmid DNA-transfected cells (M. R. Loeken, I. Bikel, D. M. Livingston, and J. Brady, Cell 55:1171-1177, 1988). To determine whether trans activation by small t might be involved in the SV40 productive infection cycle, we examined the effects of cotransfecting plasmids encoding small t with plasmids containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene linked to the SV40 early or late promoter. Small t increased three- to fivefold the expression of a CAT plasmid linked to the SV40 early promoter and enhancer. Small t expression had no effect by itself on CAT activity directed by the SV40 late promoter, but small t enhanced the effect of a suboptimal concentration of a plasmid expressing large T up to 10-fold. When the concentration of the plasmid expressing large T was increased to a level at which large T alone stimulated the late promoter ninefold, the enhancement by small t was only twofold. The effects of small t on both the SV40 early and late promoters depended on sequences within the small t-unique domain, since a plasmid expressing only the first 82 amino acids common to both large T and small t was inactive. The effects of small t on early- and late-promoter-directed CAT enzyme activity was reflected in increased CAT mRNA as measured by S1 analysis. These results suggest that SV40 small t may play a role in viral infection by increasing transcription from the early promoter and from the late promoter at times when large T levels are low.",1992
s10966,human cd8+ herpes simplex virus-specific cytotoxic t-lymphocyte clones recognize diverse virion protein antigens.,"human cd8+ herpes simplex virus-specific cytotoxic t-lymphocyte clones recognize diverse virion protein antigens.. The role of the HLA class I-restricted, CD8+, herpes simplex virus (HSV)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in the control of human HSV infections is controversial because previous reports suggest that a substantial portion of the antigen-specific lytic response is mediated by CD4+ cells. To address this question directly, we isolated HSV-specific CD8+ CTL clones from a patient with recurrent genital herpes. These CTL were cloned by coculturing responder peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with phytohemagglutinin-stimulated PBMC that had been infected with live HSV-2 and then irradiated prior to the addition of responder cells. After 1 week, CTL were cloned by limiting dilution using phytohemagglutinin stimulation and allogeneic feeder PBMC. Seven clones were isolated; all seven clones were CD8+ CD4- CD3+ DRbright, six lysed only HSV-2-infected targets, and one lysed both HSV-1- and HSV-2-infected targets. Antigen presentation was restricted by two to three different HLA class I loci. To determine the antigens recognized by these HSV-specific CTL, target cells were infected with HSV in the presence of acyclovir, 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole, or cycloheximide in a series of drug block/release protocols to limit the repertoire of viral gene expression to select transcriptional classes. Five of the clones exhibited a different pattern of cytotoxicity, suggesting that each recognized a distinct HSV antigen. One of the clones appears to be directed against an immediate-early antigen; six of the clones recognize virion proteins. Five of these clones recognized internal virion proteins that could be introduced into target cells by HSV infection in the absence of virus gene expression. Antigen specificity was further tested by using vaccinia virus vectors that express glycoproteins gD2 and gB2 or the tegument protein VP16. One clone lysed vaccinia virus/gD2-infected target cells; the remaining clones did not recognize any of these gene products. The diversity of the CD8+ response from a single individual indicated that several different antigens are recognized when presented in the context of a variety of class I HLA alleles, a pattern that markedly differs from that described for another human herpesvirus, cytomegalovirus.",1992
s10996,an endogenous antigenic peptide bypasses the class i antigen presentation defect in rma-s.,"an endogenous antigenic peptide bypasses the class i antigen presentation defect in rma-s.. The RMA-S cell line was derived from the Raucher virus-induced murine cell line RBL-5 by ethylmethane sulfonate mutagenesis and anti-H-2 antibody plus complement selection (Ljunggren, H.-G., and K. Karre. 1985. J. Exp. Med. 162:1745). RMA-S is defective in the ability to present endogenously synthesized antigens to class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) (Townsend, A., C. Ohlen, J. Bastin, H.-G. Ljunggren, L. Foster, and K. Karre. 1989. Nature [Lond.]. 340:443; Ohlen, C., J. Bastin, H.-G. Ljunggren, L. Foster, E. Wolpert, G. Klein, A. R. M. Townsend, and K. Karre. 1990. J. Immunol. 145:52). This defect has been attributed to the inability of RMA-S to deliver antigenic peptides derived from antigens in the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they can associate with class I MHC molecules (Townsend, A., C. Ohlen, J. Bastin, H.-G. Ljunggren, L. Foster, and K. Karre. 1989. Nature [Lond.]. 340:443). We show that RMA-S can present at least one endogenous antigen, vesicular stomatitis virus nucleoprotein (VSV-N), to class I MHC-restricted CTL. RMA-S presents VSV-N to CTL both when infected with VSV or transfected with the VSV nucleoprotein gene. The natural antigenic VSV nucleoprotein peptides purified from either RMA or RMA-S are indistinguishable when analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. We also show that the genetic defect responsible for the RMA-S phenotype maps to the murine chromosome 17. This chromosome encodes the murine class I MHC genes as well as two genes, HAM-1 and -2, with homology to the adenosine triphosphate-dependent transporter superfamily (Monaco, J. J., S. Cho, and M. Attaya. 1990. Science [Wash. DC]. 250:1723). These results suggest that the system that delivers antigenic peptides from the cytosol to the ER in RMA-S may still be present and retain partial function.",1992
s11030,preferential association of alpha and beta chains of the t cell antigen receptor.,"preferential association of alpha and beta chains of the t cell antigen receptor.. The cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clone B6.2.16 expresses a V beta 8.2/J beta 2.3/C beta 2-encoded T cell receptor (TcR) beta chain and an alpha chain that is encoded by a novel V alpha gene segment, J alpha 27 and C alpha. While expression of V alpha B6.2.16 and J alpha 27 is not detectable in lymph node cells of normal C57BL/6 mice, expression of these gene segments was readily seen in transgenic mice expressing the rearranged beta chain gene of the B6.2.16 T cell clone. This finding indicates that only a limited number of alpha chains can associate with the B6.2.16 beta chain and strongly suggests that the size of the TcR repertoire of mature T cells is not only limited by TcR ligand-mediated thymic selection but also by restrictions in alpha-beta combinatorial chain association.",1992
s11057,"construction of a genetically defined salmonella typhi ty2 aroa, aroc mutant for the engineering of a candidate oral typhoid-tetanus vaccine.","construction of a genetically defined salmonella typhi ty2 aroa, aroc mutant for the engineering of a candidate oral typhoid-tetanus vaccine.. The construction of a Salmonella typhi Ty2 strain harbouring defined deletions in both the aroA and aroC genes is described. These deletions have been fully defined at the molecular level by DNA sequencing and have been introduced in such a way that no foreign DNA remains in the S. typhi genome. This strain is attenuated in mice when given by the intraperitoneal route suspended in hog gastric mucin and is attenuated to a similar level to strains harbouring deletions in aroA or aroC alone indicating that both lesions are capable of attenuating independently. We have used this defined S. typhi aroA aroC strain to express stably a non-toxic 50 kDa fragment of tetanus toxin (fragment C) from a gene incorporated into the chromosome. This strain has the advantage of harbouring no antibiotic-resistance markers and we consider it to be a candidate bivalent oral typhoid-tetanus vaccine.",1992
s11120,comparison of a dengue-2 virus and its candidate vaccine derivative: sequence relationships with the flaviviruses and other viruses.,"comparison of a dengue-2 virus and its candidate vaccine derivative: sequence relationships with the flaviviruses and other viruses.. A comparison of the sequence of the dengue-2 16681 virus with that of the candidate vaccine strain (16681-PDK53) derived from it identified 53 of the 10,723 nucleotides which differed between the strains. Nucleotide changes occurred in genes coding for all virion and nonvirion proteins, and in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions. Twenty-seven of the nucleotide changes resulted in amino acid alterations. The greatest amino acid sequence differences in the virion proteins occurred in prM (2.20%; 2/91 amino acids) followed by the M protein (1.33%; 1/75 amino acids), the C protein (0.88%; 1/114 amino acid), and the E protein (0.61%; 3/495 amino acids). Differences in the amino acid sequence of nonvirion proteins ranged from 1.51% (6/398 amino acids) in NS4 to 0.33% (3/900 amino acids) in NS5. The encoded protein sequences of 16681-PDK53 were also compared with the published sequences of other flaviviruses to obtain a detailed classification of 17 flaviviruses using the neighbor-joining tree method. The analyses of the sequence data produced dendrograms which supported the traditional groupings based on serological evidence, and they suggested that the flaviviruses have evolved by divergent mutational change and there was no evidence of genetic recombination between members of the group. Comparisons of the sequences of the flavivirus polymerase and helicase-like proteins (NS5 and NS3, respectively) with those from other viruses yielded a classification of the flaviviruses indicating that the primary division of the flaviviruses was between those transmitted by mosquitoes and those transmitted by ticks.",1992
s11144,surface presentation of shigella flexneri invasion plasmid antigens requires the products of the spa locus.,"surface presentation of shigella flexneri invasion plasmid antigens requires the products of the spa locus.. An avirulent, invasion plasmid insertion mutant of Shigella flexneri 5 (pHS1059) was restored to the virulence phenotype by transformation with a partial HindIII library of the wild-type invasion plasmid constructed in pBR322. Western immunoblot analysis of pHS1059 whole-cell lysates revealed that the synthesis of the invasion plasmid antigens VirG, IpaA, IpaB, IpaC, and IpaD was similar to that seen in the corresponding isogenic S. flexneri 5 virulent strain, M90T. IpaB and IpaC, however, were not present on the surface of pHS1059 as was found in M90T, suggesting that the transport or presentation of the IpaB and IpaC proteins onto the bacterial surface was defective in the mutant. pHS1059 was complemented by pWR266, which carried contiguous 1.2- and 4.1-kb HindIII fragments of the invasion plasmid. pHS1059(pWR266) cells were positive in the HeLa cell invasion assay as well as colony immunoblot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, using monoclonal antibodies to IpaB and IpaC. These studies established that the antigens were expressed on the surface of the transformed bacteria. In addition, water extraction of pHS1059 and pHS1059(pWR266) whole cells, which can be used to remove IpaB and IpaC antigens from the surface of wild-type M90T bacteria, yielded significant amounts of these antigens from pHS1059(pWR266) but not from pHS1059. Minicell and DNA sequence analysis indicated that several proteins were encoded by pWR266, comprising the spa loci, which were mapped to a region approximately 18 kb upstream of the ipaBCDAR gene cluster. Subcloning and deletion analysis revealed that more than one protein was involved in complementing the Spa- phenotype in pHS1059. One of these proteins, Spa47, showed striking homology to ORF4 of the Bacillus subtilis flaA locus and the fliI gene sequence of Salmonella typhimurium, both of which bear strong resemblance to the alpha and beta subunits of bacterial, mitochondrial, and chloroplast proton-translocating F0F1 ATPases.",1992
s11195,cd28 and t cell antigen receptor signal transduction coordinately regulate interleukin 2 gene expression in response to superantigen stimulation.,"cd28 and t cell antigen receptor signal transduction coordinately regulate interleukin 2 gene expression in response to superantigen stimulation.. Activation of an immune response requires intercellular contact between T lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells (APC). Interaction of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) with antigen in the context of major histocompatibility molecules mediates signal transduction, but T cell activation appears to require the induction of a second costimulatory signal transduction pathway. Recent studies suggest that interaction of CD28 with B7 on APC might deliver such a costimulatory signal. To investigate the role of CD28 signal transduction during APC-dependent T cell activation, we have used Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) presented by a B7-positive APC. We used anti-B7 monoclonal antibodies and a mutant interleukin 2 (IL-2) promoter construct, unresponsive to CD28-generated signals, in transient transfection assays to examine the contribution of the CD28-B7 interaction to IL-2 gene activation. These studies indicate that the CD28-regulated signal transduction pathway is activated during SE stimulation of T cells and plays an important role in SE induction of IL-2 gene expression through its influence upon the CD28-responsive element contained within the IL-2 gene promoter. This effect is particularly profound in the activation of the IL-2 gene in peripheral blood T cells.",1992
s11213,use of gene probes based on the insertion sequence is986 to differentiate between bcg vaccine strains.,"use of gene probes based on the insertion sequence is986 to differentiate between bcg vaccine strains.. Gene probes derived from the insertion sequence IS986, which have previously been shown to differentiate isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis for epidemiological analysis, are also capable of distinguishing two groups of BCG vaccine strains. Most BCG strains have a single copy of IS986, at the same chromosomal site, while the Brazilian, Japanese and USSR strains have an additional copy at a different, common location. These results correlate with the results of previous antigenic analysis and may reflect a different clonal origin of the two groups of BCG strains.",1992
s11260,recombinant vaccine for canine parvovirus in dogs.,"recombinant vaccine for canine parvovirus in dogs.. VP2 is the major component of canine parvovirus (CPV) capsids. The VP2-coding gene was engineered to be expressed by a recombinant baculovirus under the control of the polyhedrin promoter. A transfer vector that contains the lacZ gene under the control of the p10 promoter was used in order to facilitate the selection of recombinants. The expressed VP2 was found to be structurally and immunologically indistinguishable from authentic VP2. The recombinant VP2 shows also the capability to self-assemble, forming viruslike particles similar in size and appearance to CPV virions. These viruslike particles have been used to immunize dogs in different doses and combinations of adjuvants, and the anti-CPV responses have been measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, monolayer protection assays, and an assay for the inhibition of hemagglutination. A dose of ca. 10 micrograms of VP2 was able to elicit a good protective response, higher than that obtained with a commercially available, inactivated vaccine. The results indicate that these viruslike particles can be used to protect dogs from CPV infection.",1992
s11267,an early event in murine cytomegalovirus replication inhibits presentation of cellular antigens to cytotoxic t lymphocytes.,"an early event in murine cytomegalovirus replication inhibits presentation of cellular antigens to cytotoxic t lymphocytes.. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection of simian virus 40 (SV40)-immune mice inhibits priming of SV40-specific helper and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in vivo (A. E. Campbell, J. S. Slater, and W. S. Futch, Virology 173:268-275, 1989; J. S. Slater, W. S. Futch, V. J. Cavanaugh and A. E. Campbell, Virology 185:132-139, 1991). We now demonstrate that murine CMV (MCMV) infection of SV40-transformed macrophages and fibroblasts prevents presentation of SV40 T antigen to SV40-specific CTL. MCMV-infected macrophages failed to stimulate SV40-immune CTL precursors in vitro. In addition, MCMV-infected, SV40-transformed macrophage and fibroblast target cells lost their susceptibility to lysis by major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted, SV40-specific CTL clones. MCMV infection did not alter the synthesis of SV40 T antigen in the target cells. MCMV early gene expression was required for inhibition of SV40 T-antigen presentation; immediate-early gene expression was insufficient for this effect. Early viral gene expression also resulted in significant reduction of H-2K and H-2D molecules on the surface of MCMV-infected fibroblasts. However, this reduction occurred independently from suppression of antigen presentation to CTL. The same target cells which were resistant to lysis by SV40 CTL were susceptible to lysis by MCMV-specific CTL. MCMV early gene products therefore interfere with the processing and/or presentation of SV40 T-antigen determinants to CTL independent of alterations in the major histocompatibility complex.",1992
s11756,the use of feline herpesvirus and baculovirus as vaccine vectors for the gag and env genes of feline leukaemia virus.,the use of feline herpesvirus and baculovirus as vaccine vectors for the gag and env genes of feline leukaemia virus.. The env and gag genes from feline leukaemia virus were expressed in a thymidine kinase-negative feline herpes-virus and a baculovirus. Cats were vaccinated with various combinations of these recombinant viruses and 100% protection against feline leukaemia virus challenge was achieved using an immunization schedule which utilized both env and gag products delivered at both a mucosal and systemic site.,1992
s11867,relocation of antigens to the cell surface membrane can enhance immune stimulation and protection.,"relocation of antigens to the cell surface membrane can enhance immune stimulation and protection.. The major outer capsid glycoprotein of rotaviruses, VP7, is normally synthesized and directed to the ER, where it is required for virus assembly. By substituting a foreign signal sequence for the VP7 signal peptide, a secreted form of VP7 with an authentic amino terminus was produced. Secreted VP7 was further modified by the addition of a transmembrane anchor and cytoplasmic domain to its C-terminus. When the novel chimeric protein was expressed in transfected cells it became anchored in the cell surface membrane. The antigenicity of the chimeric protein was compared with that of the intracellular form of VP7 using recombinant vaccinia viruses to deliver the antigens in vivo. The novel antigen produced enhanced stimulation of both B and T lymphocytes of the immune system, and in mice it was able to induce protection against rotavirus-induced diarrhoeal disease. Other secreted and intracellular antigens show a similar improved level of antigenicity as a result of their relocation to the cell surface. Surface localization may therefore have general utility in the development of recombinant subunit vaccines.",1992
s12450,blocking elisa for distinguishing infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (ibrv)-infected animals from those vaccinated with a gene-deleted marker vaccine.,"blocking elisa for distinguishing infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (ibrv)-infected animals from those vaccinated with a gene-deleted marker vaccine.. A sensitive and specific blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to distinguish infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV)-infected animals from those immunized with a glycoprotein gIII deletion mutant, IBRV(NG)dltkdlgIII. For this ELISA, undiluted test sera are used to block the binding of an anti-IBRV gIII monoclonal antibody (mAbgIII)-horseradish peroxidase (HRPO) conjugate to gIII antigen. TMB substrate is used for color development. Negative S/N values (defined as the absorbance at 650 nm of test sera/absorbance at 650 nm of negative control sera) of > 0.80 were obtained with immune sera from gnotobiotic cattle immunized with several bovine viruses, with bovine antisera to bovine herpesvirus-2, and vesicular stomatitis virus, with porcine antisera to pseudorabies virus and parvovirus, and with normal sera from heterologous species. Negative S/N values were also obtained with sera from rabbits twice vaccinated with IBRV(NG)dltkdlgIII. However, the S/N values became positive (S/N < 0.8) 10 to 17 days after the rabbits were challenge exposed to virulent IBRV(Cooper). Most of 116 sera (84%) from feedlot cattle with virus neutralization (VN) titers of < 1:2 or < 1:4 had negative S/N values > 0.8, but 18 sera with negative VN titers had positive S/N values, consistent with observations indicating that an IBRV outbreak was occurring in one of the feedlot herds. Thirty nine sera (98%) from feedlot cattle with VN titers of 1:2 to 1:128 had positive S/N values (< 0.8). One serum with a VN titer of 1:2 had a borderline (+/-) S/N value of 0.81. After immunization with a commercial gIII-positive IBRV vaccine, 115/116 sera with VN titers of 1:2 to 1:256 had positive S/N values (< 0.8). One serum with a VN titer of 1:2 had a negative S/N value of 0.83. Serum from one vaccinated animal that failed to seroconvert after vaccination (VN < 1:4) showed a strongly positive ELISA S/N of 0.48.",1992
s12471,multiple amino acids in the capsid structure of canine parvovirus coordinately determine the canine host range and specific antigenic and hemagglutination properties.,"multiple amino acids in the capsid structure of canine parvovirus coordinately determine the canine host range and specific antigenic and hemagglutination properties.. Canine parvovirus (CPV) and feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) are over 98% similar in DNA sequence but have specific host range, antigenic, and hemagglutination (HA) properties which were located within the capsid protein gene. In vitro mutagenesis and recombination were used to prepare 16 different recombinant genomic clones, and viruses derived from those clones were analyzed for their in vitro host range, antigenic, and HA properties. The region of CPV from 59 to 91 map units determined the ability to replicate in canine cells. A complex series of interactions was observed among the individual sequence differences between 59 and 73 map units. The canine host range required that VP2 amino acids (aa) 93 and 323 both be the CPV sequence, and those two CPV sequences introduced alone into FPV greatly increased viral replication in canine cells. Changing any one of aa 93, 103, or 323 of CPV to the FPV sequence either greatly decreased replication in canine cells or resulted in an inviable plasmid. The Asn-Lys difference of aa 93 alone was responsible for the CPV-specific epitope recognized by monoclonal antibodies. An FPV-specific epitope was affected by aa 323. Amino acids 323 and 375 together determined the pH dependence of HA. Amino acids involved in the various specific properties were all around the threefold spikes of the viral particle.",1992
s12601,identification and functional analysis of the fowlpox virus homolog of the vaccinia virus p37k major envelope antigen gene.,"identification and functional analysis of the fowlpox virus homolog of the vaccinia virus p37k major envelope antigen gene.. A fowlpox virus (FPV) gene with homology to the vaccinia virus p37K major envelope antigen gene was identified and sequenced. The predicted product has a molecular weight of 43,018 Da (p43K). The FPV p43K gene has 37.5% identity with its vaccinia counterpart and higher homology with a molluscum contagiosum virus gene (42.6% identity). Based on upstream sequences, p43K appears to be regulated as a late gene. Recombinant FPV were generated in which a large portion of p43K was replaced by the Escherichia coli lacZ gene. These recombinants failed to produce visible plaques under standard conditions. After prolonged incubation the microplaques developed into small macroscopic plaques. Plaques were purified on the basis of lacZ expression. Single-cycle growth curves comparing the p43K-deleted recombinant (designated fJd43Z) with parental FPV showed that the two viruses produce identical amounts of intracellular virions, but that fJd43Z released 20-fold fewer infectious particles into the medium. CsCl gradient centrifugation of [3H]thymidine-labeled virus was employed to examine differences in the production of physical particles. The two viruses produced equivalent levels of intracellular virions, but fJd43Z failed to produce detectable levels of released particles. FPV p43K is therefore involved in the release of virions from infected cells.",1992
s12637,antigenic variant of swine influenza virus causing proliferative and necrotizing pneumonia in pigs.,"antigenic variant of swine influenza virus causing proliferative and necrotizing pneumonia in pigs.. A new antigenic variant of swine influenza virus was isolated from the lungs of pigs experiencing respiratory problems in 7 different swine herds in Quebec. Pigs of different ages were affected, and the main clinical signs were fever, dyspnea, and abdominal respiration. Coughing was not a constant finding of the syndrome. At necropsy, macroscopic lesions included the overall appearance of pale animals, general lymphadenopathy, hepatic congestion, and consolidation of the lungs. Histopathologic findings were mainly proliferative pneumonia with a significant macrophage invasion, necrotic inflammatory cells in the alveoli and the airways, a marked proliferation of type II pneumocytes, and thickening of the alveolar septae. Fluorescent antibody examination of lungs of sick piglets did not demonstrate porcine parvovirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, or encephalomyocarditis virus. However, evidence of the presence of an influenza type A infection was demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) staining using monoclonal antibody directed to nucleocapsid protein (NP) of human type A influenza virus. The virus was isolated either by intra-allantoic inoculation of specific-pathogen-free embryonating hens' eggs or propagation in canine kidney (MDCK) cells in the presence of trypsin. By hemagglutination inhibition tests, no cross-reactivity was demonstrated with human influenza H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 strains, and infected MDCK cells did not react by IIF with monoclonal antibodies to NP protein of type B influenza virus. The hemagglutination activity of plaque-purified isolates was only partly inhibited by hyperimmune serum produced to subtypes A/Wisconsin/76/H1N1 and A/New Jersey/76/H1N1 of swine influenza virus. Gnotobiotic piglets that were infected intranasally with egg-adapted isolates of this new antigenic variant of swine influenza virus developed the very same type of lesions observed in field cases.",1992
s12748,"production, quality control and characterization of an inactivated hepatitis a vaccine.","production, quality control and characterization of an inactivated hepatitis a vaccine.. The isolation and adaptation of hepatitis A virus to cell culture opened the way to the development of vaccines. Based on experience with inactivated poliovaccines, a similar approach was chosen for the development of an inactivated hepatitis A vaccine. Strain HM175, adapted to MRC-5 human diploid cells, was used as the virus strain. Vaccine production starts with growth and multiplication of the seed virus in MRC-5 cells. The harvests are clarified, purified and concentrated. Inactivation by formaldehyde is carried out on a pool of purified harvests. Close control of all process parameters results in consistent production of completely inactivated and highly immunogenic vaccine lots. Quality control testing is based on the general requirements for biologicals of WHO and National Control Authorities. Tests have been developed and validated to show the purity of the cell substrate used for each production cycle, the quality of the virus harvest, the adequacy of the purification and inactivation processes, and the conformity to stringent specifications for purity, safety and potency of the final bulk vaccine filled in final containers. The vaccine is characterized by adequate identity tests, by its reaction with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, by its immunogenicity in laboratory animals and by the detailed study of the immune response in primates and human volunteers. The final result of the development of adequate production and testing methods, confirmed by extensive characterization studies, is the availability of a consistent, safe and potent hepatitis A vaccine.",1992
s12926,major histocompatibility complex (mhc)-encoded ham2 is necessary for antigenic peptide loading onto class i mhc molecules.,"major histocompatibility complex (mhc)-encoded ham2 is necessary for antigenic peptide loading onto class i mhc molecules.. The mutant murine lymphoma cell line RMA-S is unable to present endogenous antigens due to its inability to efficiently assemble class I major histocompatibility complex molecules and antigenic peptides. Therefore, it has been suggested that RMA-S cells are defective either in peptide generation or in peptide transport into the endoplasmic reticulum, where class I major histocompatibility complex molecule assembly is believed to occur. As proteasomes and the putative peptide transporters HAM1 and HAM2 have been implicated in class I antigen processing, we have investigated their expression in RMA-S and its wild-type counterpart RMA. Both proteasomes and HAM1 proteins are expressed at similar levels and show identical subcellular distributions in the two cell lines. However, only one copy of the HAM2 gene is present in RMA-S cells, and it contains a point mutation that leads to a premature stop codon. Thus, the HAM2 protein is absent from RMA-S cells. These data demonstrate that HAM2 is essential for peptide loading onto class I molecules.",1992
s13077,heat-stable antigen is a costimulatory molecule for cd4 t cell growth.,"heat-stable antigen is a costimulatory molecule for cd4 t cell growth.. Optimal induction of clonal expansion by normal CD4 T cells requires a ligand that can engage the T cell receptor as well as functionally defined costimulatory activity on the same antigen-presenting cell surface. While the presence of effective costimulation induces proliferation, T cell receptor ligation in its absence renders T cells inactive or anergic. The molecular basis of this costimulatory activity remains to be defined. Here we describe a monoclonal antibody that can block the costimulatory activity of splenic accessory cells. Treatment with this antibody not only blocks the proliferation of CD4 T cells to a T cell receptor ligand, but also induces T cell nonresponsiveness to subsequent stimulation. Sequence analysis of the antigen recognized by this antibody indicates that it recognizes a protein that is identical to heat-stable antigen. Gene transfer experiments directly demonstrate that this protein has costimulatory activity. Thus, heat-stable antigen meets the criteria for a costimulator of T cell clonal expansion.",1992
s13132,preparation of candidate vaccinia-vectored vaccines for haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.,"preparation of candidate vaccinia-vectored vaccines for haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.. Two vaccinia-vectored candidate vaccines for haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome were prepared by inserting cDNA, representing the medium (M) genome segment, or the M and the small (S) genome segments of Hantaan virus into the thymidine kinase gene of the Connaught vaccine strain of vaccinia virus. In the single recombinant, the M segment was placed under control of the vaccinia virus 7.5 kDa promoter. In the double recombinant, the M and S segments were placed under control of the vaccinia virus 7.5 kDa and 11 kDa promoters, respectively. An immunoplaque assay technique was developed to select recombinants without the need for expression of irrelevant genes or use of potential mutagens. Proteins indistinguishable from authentic viral envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid protein were observed by immunoprecipitation with antibodies to Hantaan virus. The recombinant expressing both the M and the S segments was selected for further development and testing as a human vaccine.",1992
s13148,stimulation of human naive and memory t helper cells with bacterial superantigen. naive cd4+45ra+ t cells require a costimulatory signal mediated through the lfa-1/icam-1 pathway.,"stimulation of human naive and memory t helper cells with bacterial superantigen. naive cd4+45ra+ t cells require a costimulatory signal mediated through the lfa-1/icam-1 pathway.. The role of the accessory molecule ICAM-1 in activation of subpopulations of human T cells was examined using the bacterial superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) as a MHC class II and TCR-dependent polyclonal T cell activator. Human T cells responded with different sensitivity to SEA when presented on mouse accessory cells expressing a human transfected MHC class II gene product. Mouse L cells cotransfected with both MHC class II (DR2A or DR7) and ICAM-1-stimulated T cells at 100-fold lower concentrations of SEA as compared to the single transfected cells. mAb reacting with the CD11a, CD18, or ICAM-1 molecules efficiently inhibited T cell activation with the cotransfected HLA-DR2A/ICAM-1 cell but did not influence T cell activation with the HLA-DR2A single transfected cell. Analysis of the ICAM-1 requirement on CD4+ memory (CD4+45RO+) and naive (CD4+45RA+) T cells revealed that CD4+45RA+ naive Th cells were hyporesponsive to SEA-induced activation with the HLA-DR2A single transfectant. However, cotransfection of ICAM-1 enabled these cells to respond to low doses of SEA implicating that they are more dependent on accessory molecules than the CD4+45RO+ cells. rICAM-1 immobilized on a plastic surface, was able to strongly costimulate SEA-induced T cell activation with the HLA-DR2A single transfectant, suggesting that costimulatory signals mediated to the T cells through LFA-1 can be delivered physically separated from the TCR signal. CD4+45RO+ memory and CD4+45RA+ naive Th cells apparently differ in their capacities to be activated by SEA bound to HLA-DR. Although the TCR molecule densities are similar in these two subsets, costimulation with ICAM-1 is required for activation of the CD4+45RA+, but not the CD4+45RO+ T cell subset at 1 to 10,000 ng/ml concentrations of SEA. This observation indicates different activation thresholds of naive and memory Th cells when triggering the TCR over a wide dose interval of superantigen.",1992
s13259,expression of sv-40 t antigen in the small intestinal epithelium of transgenic mice results in proliferative changes in the crypt and reentry of villus-associated enterocytes into the cell cycle but has no apparent effect on cellular differentiation programs and does not cause neoplastic transformation.,"expression of sv-40 t antigen in the small intestinal epithelium of transgenic mice results in proliferative changes in the crypt and reentry of villus-associated enterocytes into the cell cycle but has no apparent effect on cellular differentiation programs and does not cause neoplastic transformation.. The mouse intestinal epithelium represents a unique mammalian system for examining the relationship between cell division, commitment, and differentiation. Proliferation and differentiation are rapid, perpetual, and spatially well-organized processes that occur along the crypt-to-villus axis and involve clearly defined cell lineages derived from a common multipotent stem cell located near the base of each crypt. Nucleotides -1178 to +28 of the rat intestinal fatty acid binding protein gene were used to establish three pedigrees of transgenic mice that expressed SV-40 large T antigen (TAg) in epithelial cells situated in the uppermost portion of small intestinal crypts and in already committed, differentiating enterocytes as they exited these crypts and migrated up the villus. T antigen production was associated with increases in crypt cell proliferation but had no apparent effect on commitment to differentiate along enterocytic, enteroendocrine, or Paneth cell lineages. Single- and multilabel-immunocytochemical studies plus RNA blot hybridization analyses suggested that the differentiation programs of these lineages were similar in transgenic mice and their normal littermates. This included enterocytes which, based on the pattern of [3H]thymidine and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine labeling and proliferating nuclear antigen expression, had reentered the cell cycle during their migration up the villus. The state of cellular differentiation and/or TAg production appeared to affect the nature of the cell cycle; analysis of the ratio of S-phase to M-phase cells (collected by metaphase arrest with vincristine) and of the intensities of labeling of nuclei by [3H]thymidine indicated that the duration of S phase was longer in differentiating, villus-associated enterocytes than in the less well-differentiated crypt epithelial cell population and that there may be a block at the G2/M boundary. Sustained increases in crypt and villus epithelial cell proliferation over a 9-mo period were not associated with the development of gut neoplasms--suggesting that tumorigenesis in the intestine may require that the initiated cell have many of the properties of the gut stem cell including functional anchorage.",1992

Overall, the meeting was timely and worthwhile. It is evident that there is a need for comparative studies to establish a firm foundation for future work. This is particularly important since it appears that the responses observed are influenced by the particular strain used for attenuation, the means of attenuation, the antigen-presentation system employed and the animal most immunized. In this last regard, one must recognize that most work to date has been with inbred strains of mice which differ from the genetic diversity of most hosts that are the intended beneficiaries of the immunization strategies being developed.",1990

Plasmid pTETnir15, which directs the expression of the non-toxic immunogenic fragment C of tetanus toxin from the anaerobically inducible nirB promoter, was introduced into the Salmonella typhimurium aroA aroD live oral vaccine strain BRD509. The resulting strain, designated BRD847, was used to vaccinate orally BALB/c mice and was tested for plasmid stability and its ability to protect against a lethal tetanus toxin challenge. pTETnir15 was stably inherited by bacteria growing or persisting in the tissues of immunized mice whereas another BRD509 derivative, designated BRD753, harboring plasmid pTET85 which directs fragment C expression from the tac promoter, was highly unstable. Mice immunized with a single oral dose of BRD847 developed high levels of circulating anti-fragment C antibodies and were solidly protected against tetanus toxin challenge. Mice immunized with a single oral dose of BRD753 developed no detectable anti-fragment C antibodies. After boosting, antibodies were detected, but the mice were only partially protected against tetanus toxin challenge. Thus the use of an in vivo inducible promoter such as nirB may be a generally applicable approach to obtaining the stable in vivo expression of heterologous antigens in Salmonella vaccine strains.",1992

To date, the most significant use of recombinant-DNA technologies has been to hyperproduce natural molecules that are difficult to obtain in large quantities by conventional methods. However, genetic manipulation can also be an efficient way to modify the properties of natural molecules in order to make them more suitable for human use. In the development of third-generation whooping cough vaccines, recombinant-DNA methods were used to remove the enzymatic activity of pertussis toxin in order to obtain a new molecule which is devoid of toxicity, and can be used for safer vaccination against this disease.",1991
s14602,"androgens up-regulate the human prostate-specific antigen messenger ribonucleic acid (mrna), but down-regulate the prostatic acid phosphatase mrna in the lncap cell line.","androgens up-regulate the human prostate-specific antigen messenger ribonucleic acid (mrna), but down-regulate the prostatic acid phosphatase mrna in the lncap cell line.. To better understand androgen-regulated gene expression in the prostate, we have used Northern blot analysis to study the effects of androgens and other steroid hormones on the steady state levels of several human prostatic mRNAs in the LNCaP cell line. Dihydrotestosterone (40 nM) as well as a synthetic androgen, R1881 (0.1 nM), increased the amounts of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and human glandular kallikrein mRNAs; at the same time, the level of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) mRNA was down-regulated. Incubation of LNCaP cells with medium containing 0.1 or 1 microM R1881 for 3, 7, or 13 days resulted in up-regulation of PSA and human glandular kallikrein mRNAs and down-regulation of PAP mRNA. Thus, the two clinically important prostate-specific marker proteins are inversely regulated in this cell line. The level of human androgen receptor mRNA was also repressed by the androgen treatments. 17 beta-Estradiol and progesterone had effects similar to those of R1881 on gene expression in LNCaP cells. Our results show that the decrease in the amount of secreted PAP and the increase in the amount of secreted PSA caused by androgens and other steroid hormones in the LNCaP cells of epithelial origin are mediated by changes in the levels of the corresponding mRNAs.",1992
s14620,"the 14,000-molecular-weight antigen of mycobacterium tuberculosis is related to the alpha-crystallin family of low-molecular-weight heat shock proteins.","the 14,000-molecular-weight antigen of mycobacterium tuberculosis is related to the alpha-crystallin family of low-molecular-weight heat shock proteins.. Eight monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against the 14,000-molecular-weight (14K) antigen of Mycobacterium tuberculosis reacted specifically with mycobacteria of the M. tuberculosis complex. The nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the 14K antigen was determined by using recombinant DNA clones isolated from lambda gt11 and cosmid libraries of the M. tuberculosis genome. The DNA sequence of the 14K protein gene coded for a polypeptide of 144 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 16,277 Da. The 14K antigen has a marked homology with proteins belonging to the alpha-crystallin family of low-molecular-weight heat shock proteins, which includes the 18K antigen of M. leprae. The eight MAbs recognized at least four distinct epitopes localized within the following three regions of the 14K protein: amino acids 10 to 92 (MAbs F67-8 and F67-16), amino acids 41 to 92 (F159-1 and F159-11), and amino acids 41 to 144 (F23-41, F24-2, F23-49, and TB68).",1992

We have produced the human class II histocompatibility protein, HLA-DR1, as a soluble, secreted glycoprotein in insect cells infected with baculoviruses carrying truncated alpha and beta subunit genes. The peptide-binding site is empty, and the empty molecules are fully competent to bind antigenic peptide. We used the empty molecules to measure an intrinsic rate for peptide association, and to investigate the role of peptide in stabilizing the class II structure. Peptide binding kinetics for the empty molecule are only 10-fold faster than for peptide exchange into an occupied site, suggesting that a conformational change may accompany peptide binding. The native alpha beta heterodimer assembles in the absence of antigenic peptide, but peptide binding stabilizes the empty heterodimer against aggregation and against SDS-induced denaturation.",1992

Synthetic peptide constructs containing a limited number of epitopes are being currently investigated as subunit vaccines against a variety of pathogens. However, because of widespread nonresponsiveness to most such constructs, possibly attributable to MHC restriction, the choice of appropriate carrier molecules to enhance immunogenicity of peptides constitutes an important and essential aspect of designing synthetic immunogens for human use. Widely used vaccines such as tetanus toxoid (TT) have not been uniformly effective as carrier proteins because of the phenomenon of epitope-specific suppression in which induction of an immune response against a synthetic peptide conjugated to TT is prevented by preexisting immunity to TT. Recently, T cell determinants that can be recognized in the context of several class II MHC molecules have been identified in tetanus toxin as well as in the circumsporozoite protein of a human malarial parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Such determinants can be potentially used to circumvent the problem of epitope-specific suppression. In the present study we evaluated two such T cell determinants, viz., tt830-844 from tetanus toxin and CST3 from the malarial parasite, for their ability to help induce a boostable antibody response and to overcome genetic nonresponsiveness to a synthetic 20-residue construct containing a B cell and an overlapping T cell epitope from a major merozoite surface protein of P. falciparum. Our data provide support for the view that widely recognized T cell determinants may be used as universal carrier molecules for general vaccination.",1992

Mice carrying the lymphoproliferation (lpr) mutation have defects in the Fas antigen gene.

Sindbis virus (SIN) is a small positive-strand enveloped RNA virus that infects a broad range of vertebrate and insect cells. A SIN vector (called dsSIN), designed for transient expression of heterologous RNAs and proteins, was engineered by inserting a second subgenomic mRNA promoter sequence into a nonessential region of the SIN genome. By using this vector, dsSIN recombinants have been constructed that express either bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, a truncated form of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA), or mini-genes encoding two distinct immunodominant cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) HA epitopes. Infection of murine cell lines with these recombinants resulted in the expression of approximately 10(6)-10(7) chloramphenicol acetyltransferase polypeptides per cell and efficient sensitization of target cells for lysis by appropriate major histocompatibility complex-restricted HA-specific CTL clones in vitro. In addition, priming of an influenza-specific T-cell response was observed after immunizing mice with dsSIN recombinants expressing either a truncated form of HA or the immunodominant influenza CTL epitopes. This SIN expression system allows the generation of high-titered recombinant virus stocks in a matter of days and should facilitate mapping and mutational analysis of class I major histocompatibility complex-restricted T-cell epitopes expressed via the endogenous pathway of antigen processing and presentation.",1992
s14910,human combinatorial antibody libraries to hepatitis b surface antigen.,human combinatorial antibody libraries to hepatitis b surface antigen.. Human antibody Fab fragments that bind to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were generated by using a recombinant phage surface-display expression system. Characterization of HBsAg-specific Fab fragments isolated from two vaccinated individuals reveals diversity in specificity of antigen binding and in the sequences of the complementarity-determining region. The sequence results show examples of human light-chain promiscuity that result in fine specificity changes and a strong relationship to a human germ-line gene. This application illustrates further that this technique is a powerful tool to isolate distinct human antibodies against immunogenic viral targets.,1992

Transgenic mice bearing a human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) promoter-SV40 T antigen fusion transgene were generated in order to localize in vivo the potential oncogenesis linked to the tissue-specific activity of the promoter for the CFTR gene. Surprisingly, the only site of tumors resulting from expression of the reporter onc gene was ependymal cells lining the brain ventricles. SV40 T antigen expression in these cells led to a consistent pathology in the first weeks of age: ependymoma and consequent hydrocephaly. Tumor-derived cell lines were established, characterized and shown to originate from SV40 T antigen-induced ependymoma. No pathological alterations were found in other organs, such as lungs and pancreas, in which cystic fibrosis is pathologically manifest in humans. Such transgenic mice and derived cell lines may represent valid models for analysing (1) the role of SV40 T antigen in ependymoma formation and (2) CFTR function in ependymal cells.",1992

Further, synthetic chimeric peptides that combine strong T cell epitopes with poorly immunogenic, but immunodominant, B cell epitopes or strain-conserved B cell epitopes may be useful in eliciting antibody to such important regions. Here we characterize a human T cell epitope analyzed in 54 individuals immunized with a hepatitis B virus surface Ag vaccine. Primary cultures from a total of 59 immunized donors were assessed for their ability to respond to hepatitis B virus surface Ag and peptides, and five were non-responders (8.5%).

The V3 loop is the region to which significant neutralizing antibody is directed. Thus, a strong immune response to a synthetic peptide that contains the strain-conserved V3 loop region could have significant therapeutic implications. The V3 loop/19-33 peptide was then used to prime mice, to determine whether V3 loop-specific antibody could be induced. The peptide elicited potent 19-33-specific proliferation in T cells isolated from draining lymph nodes, and in six of six mice anti-V3 loop antibody was elicited. Further, V3 loop/19-33-primed animals made significant levels of antibody that bound rgp120. These data suggest that, when a major T cell epitope is synthesized in tandem with the V3 loop, a significant immune response against the loop can be elicited. Thus, given the finding that neutralizing antibody may play a role in the control and/or prevention of HIV infection, an HIV vaccine composed of a T cell epitope-containing peptide may prove effective. In addition, this type of approach can be generalized to the design of peptide-based vaccines.",1992
s15185,an antigenic determinant on human centromere protein b (cenp-b) available for production of human-specific anticentromere antibodies in mouse.,"an antigenic determinant on human centromere protein b (cenp-b) available for production of human-specific anticentromere antibodies in mouse.. Centromere protein B (CENP-B) is one of the centromere DNA binding proteins constituting centromere heterochromatin throughout the cell cycles. Some components of mammalian centromeres including CENP-B are target antigens for autoimmune disease patients, often those with scleroderma. Recent isolations of CENP-B genes from human and mouse suggested that CENP-B was highly conserved among mammals. From the previous analysis of the reactivity of patient anticentromere sera, two autoepitopes have been located on the DNA binding domain at the amino-terminal region. The amino acid sequences for both the epitopes are perfectly conserved in the two species, human and mouse. In this study, to identify a human-specific antigenic determinant, the remaining two epitopes were further located in separate carboxyl-terminal regions of human CENP-B. Although the amino acid sequence of one epitope is identical to that of the corresponding region in mouse CENP-B, the other has a less homologous sequence. To confirm that the latter epitope was available for production of human-specific anticentromere antibodies, mice were immunized with the recombinant human CENP-B product. One serum that exclusively stained human centromere structure, but not that of other mammals, was identified in the immunofluorescence microscopic observation. The epitope analysis showed that the less conserved one was recognized by this serum. These results suggested that the corresponding region defines the antigenic determinants for the species specificity.",1992

The human B lymphocyte activation antigen B7 provides regulatory signals for T lymphocytes as a consequence of binding to its ligands CD28 and CTLA-4. The cDNA for B7 has previously been isolated and predicted to encode a type I membrane protein. The predicted polypeptide has a secretory signal peptide followed by two contiguous Ig-like domains, a hydrophobic transmembrane region and a short cytoplasmic tail. Here we report the exon-intron genomic organization of human B7 and the chromosomal location. The gene has six exons that span approximately 32 kilobases of DNA. Exon 1 is not translated and the second exon contains the initiation ATG codon and encodes a predicted signal peptide. This gene structure is characteristic for several eukaryotic genes with tissue-specific expression. The third and fourth exons correspond to two Ig-like domains whereas the fifth and sixth exons encode respectively the trans-membrane portion and the cytoplasmic tail. This close relationship between exons and functional domains is a characteristic feature of genes of the Ig superfamily. Cell surface expression of the B7 gene product has previously been mapped to human chromosome 12 by antibody reactivity with the B7-specific monoclonal antibody BB-1. We here demonstrate that the B7 gene is located to the q21-qter region of chromosome 3 by DNA blot analysis of human x rodent somatic cell hybrids.",1992
s15233,spreading of t-cell autoimmunity to cryptic determinants of an autoantigen.,"spreading of t-cell autoimmunity to cryptic determinants of an autoantigen.. Immunization with myelin basic protein (MBP) induces experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), a prototype of CD4+ T-cell mediated autoimmune disease. In rodents, MBP-reactive T-cell clones are specific for a single, dominant determinant on MBP and use a highly restricted number of T-cell receptor genes. Accordingly, EAE has been prevented by various receptor-specific treatments, suggesting similar strategies may be useful for therapy of human autoimmune disease. Here we report that in (SJL x B10.PL)F1 mice, immune dominance of a single determinant, MBP:Ac1-11, is confined to the inductive phase of EAE. In mice with chronic EAE, several additional determinants of MBP in peptides 35-47, 81-100 and 121-140 recall proliferative responses. Most importantly, reactivity to the latter determinants was also detected after induction of EAE with MBP peptide Ac1-11 alone; this demonstrates priming by endogenous MBP determinants. Thus, determinants of MBP that are cryptic after primary immunization can become immunogenic in the course of EAE. Diversification of the autoreactive T-cell repertoire due to 'determinant spreading' has major implications for the pathogenesis of, and the therapeutic approach to, T-cell driven autoimmune disease.",1992

Serotyping of group A rotaviruses obtained from stools of 158 diarrheic patients in Chiang Mai, Thailand, by ELISA with monoclonal antibodies revealed a yearly change in the prevalence of individual serotypes. Three unusual human rotavirus strains were isolated. Strain Mc35 had subgroup I-serotype 10 antigen and a long RNA electrophoretic type, a property hitherto found only in bovine rotaviruses. RNA-RNA hybridization tests showed that the strain is more closely related genetically to bovine than to human rotaviruses. Strain Mc323, although serologically closely related to serotype 9, had subgroup I specificity and a long RNA electrophoretic type, a characteristic common to nonhuman rotaviruses. Strain Mc345, with an aberrant RNA pattern possibly due to genome rearrangement, had the same antigenic specificity as Mc323. These 2 strains were genetically very closely related to each other and were more related to porcine than to human rotaviruses. These results provide insights into the evolutionary mechanisms of human rotaviruses.",1992
s15448,"the mycobacterium tuberculosis 38-kda antigen: overproduction in escherichia coli, purification and characterization.","the mycobacterium tuberculosis 38-kda antigen: overproduction in escherichia coli, purification and characterization.. The 38-kDa protein (Ag38) of the Gram+ bacterium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, is an immunodominant antigen of potential utility for diagnosis and vaccine development. Assessment of this potential requires large amounts of the purified protein that would be difficult, if not impossible, to obtain from M. tuberculosis itself. The gene coding for Ag38 had been previously cloned and in the present study was expressed as an unfused protein in Escherichia coli under the control of strong transcriptional (bacteriophage lambda pLpR) and translational (atpE) signals. Fermentation of the recombinant E. coli K-12 strain CAG629[pMS9-2], which is deficient in Lon protease and the heat-shock response, produced recombinant Ag38 (reAg38) at high levels (about 10% of total cellular protein). The reAg38, which accumulated as inclusion bodies, was completely solubilized in 6 M guanidine.HCl, refolded and purified to apparent homogeneity. The product showed the expected amino acid composition and M(r), and had similar reactivities as the native protein with three different mAb. Polyclonal antibodies raised against reAg38 reacted strongly with the native antigen in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These results demonstrate that reAg38, which cannot be distinguished antigenically from the native protein of M. tuberculosis, can be prepared in quantity from E. coli.",1992
s15507,characterization of the lymphocyte activation gene 3-encoded protein. a new ligand for human leukocyte antigen class ii antigens.,"characterization of the lymphocyte activation gene 3-encoded protein. a new ligand for human leukocyte antigen class ii antigens.. The lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3), expressed in human activated T and natural killer (NK) cells, is closely related to CD4 at the gene and protein levels. We report here the initial characterization of the LAG-3-encoded protein. We have generated two monoclonal antibodies after immunization of mice with a 30-amino acid peptide that corresponds to an exposed extra loop region present in the LAG-3 immunoglobulin-like first domain. The reactivity of these reagents is directed against LAG-3 since they recognize both membrane-expressed and soluble recombinant LAG-3 molecules produced in a baculovirus expression system. The two antibodies are likely to react with the same or closely related epitope (termed LAG-3.1) exposed on the LAG-3 first domain extra loop, as assessed in competition experiments on LAG-3-expressing activated lymphocytes. Cellular distribution analysis indicated that the LAG-3.1 epitope is expressed on activated T (both CD4+ and CD8+ subsets) and NK cells, and not on activated B cells or monocytes. In immunoprecipitation experiments performed on activated T and NK cell lysates, a 70-kD protein was detected after SDS-PAGE analysis. 45-kD protein species were also immunoprecipitated. Both the 70- and 45-kD proteins were shown to be N-glycosylated. In Western blot analysis, only the former molecule was recognized by the anti-LAG-3 antibodies, demonstrating that it is LAG-3 encoded. These anti-LAG-3 antibodies were used to investigate whether the LAG-3 protein interacts with the CD4 ligands. By using a high-level expression cellular system based on COS-7 cell transfection with recombinant CDM8 vectors and a quantitative cellular adhesion assay, we demonstrate that rosette formation between LAG-3-transfected COS-7 cells and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II-bearing B lymphocytes is specifically dependent on LAG-3/HLA class II interaction. In contrast to CD4, LAG-3 does not bind the human immunodeficiency virus gp120. This initial characterization will guide further studies on the functions of this molecule, which may play an important role in immune responses mediated by T and NK lymphocytes.",1992
s15610,mouse tumor rejection antigens p815a and p815b: two epitopes carried by a single peptide.,"mouse tumor rejection antigens p815a and p815b: two epitopes carried by a single peptide.. Mouse mastocytoma P815 expresses several distinct tumor rejection antigens recognized by syngeneic cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL). Two of these tumor rejection antigens, P815A and P815B, are encoded by gene P1A, the sequence of which was reported previously. Tumor cell variants having lost one or both of these antigens were isolated by in vitro selection with CTL and also by collecting tumor cells that progressed in vivo after escaping a nearly complete immune rejection process. The structure of gene P1A in these antigen-loss variants was examined. Several A-B- variants presented a complete or partial deletion of the gene. One variant that had lost only antigen A displayed a point mutation in the first exon. Peptides were synthesized that corresponded to the normal sequence located in the region of this point mutation. They sensitized target cells to both anti-A and anti-B CTL. The homologous peptide encoded by the mutated gene of the P815 A-B+ variant sensitized cells only to anti-B CTL. We conclude that anti-A and anti-B CTL recognize on the same peptide two distinct epitopes that are affected differently by the mutation.",1992
s15630,structure of the cd59-encoding gene: further evidence of a relationship to murine lymphocyte antigen ly-6 protein.,"structure of the cd59-encoding gene: further evidence of a relationship to murine lymphocyte antigen ly-6 protein.. The gene for CD59 [membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (MIRL), protectin], a phosphatidylinositol-linked surface glycoprotein that regulates the formation of the polymeric C9 complex of complement and that is deficient on the abnormal hematopoietic cells of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, consists of four exons spanning 20 kilobases. The untranslated first exon is preceded by a G+C-rich promoter region that lacks a consensus TATA or CAAT motif. The second exon encodes the hydrophobic leader sequence of the protein, and the third exon encodes the amino-terminal portion of the mature protein. The fourth exon encodes the remainder of the mature protein, including the hydrophobic sequence necessary for glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor attachment. The structure of the CD59 gene is very similar to that encoding Ly-6, a murine glycoprotein with which CD59 has some structural similarity. The striking similarity in gene structure is further evidence that the two proteins belong to a superfamily of proteins that may also include the urokinase plasminogen-activator receptor and a squid glycoprotein of unknown function.",1992
s15668,immunogenic properties of multiple antigen peptide systems containing defined t and b epitopes.,"immunogenic properties of multiple antigen peptide systems containing defined t and b epitopes.. Immunization with chemically defined synthetic polymers, multiple Ag peptide (MAP) systems, containing T and B epitopes of the circumsporozoite protein of P. berghei induce high levels of circulating antibodies that are detectable several months after boosting. The anti-MAP secondary antibody response is characterized by an increase in the levels of circulating IgG and a concomitant decrease in the IgM levels. In vitro and in vivo experiments indicated that Th epitopes included in the MAP are recognized by T cells induced after immunization with the native protein and, also, that MAP-induced T cells can recognize the native protein. In addition to high levels of anti-B epitope antibodies, MAP immunization also induces antibodies against the T epitope. This anti-T epitope immune response does not affect the generation of the anti-B epitope antibodies. Immunization of different strains of mice revealed that the antibody response is consistent with the genetically restricted pattern of recognition of the T epitope. There are, however, significant differences in the levels of antibody responses observed among responder strains. The findings of this study indicate that MAP are potent immunogens capable of inducing immunologic memory and are, thus, good candidates for the development of subunit vaccines designed to induce high levels of circulating antibodies.",1992
s15903,"the human t cell antigen gp39, a member of the tnf gene family, is a ligand for the cd40 receptor: expression of a soluble form of gp39 with b cell co-stimulatory activity.","the human t cell antigen gp39, a member of the tnf gene family, is a ligand for the cd40 receptor: expression of a soluble form of gp39 with b cell co-stimulatory activity.. Signals delivered to B cells via CD40 can synergize with those provided by other B cell surface receptors to induce B cell proliferation and antibody class switching as well as modulate cytokine production and cell adhesion. Recently, it has been shown that the ligand for CD40 is a cell surface protein of approximately 39 kDa expressed by activated T cells, gp39. Here we report on the isolation and characterization of a cDNA clone encoding human gp39, a type II membrane protein with homology to TNF, and the construction and characterization of a soluble recombinant form of gp39. COS cell transfectants expressing gp39 synergized with either anti-CD20 mAb or PMA to drive strong B cell proliferation and alone were able to drive B cells to proliferate weakly. In all cases the B cell proliferation induced by gp39-expressing COS cells was reduced to background levels by the addition of soluble CD40. Unlike gp39-expressing COS cells, recombinant soluble gp39 was not mitogenic alone and required co-stimulation to drive B cell proliferation. These results suggest that B cells require a second signal besides gp39-CD40 to drive proliferation and that soluble gp39 alone in a non-membrane bound form is able to provide co-stimulatory signals to B cells.",1992
s15928,role of escherichia coli k-12 rfa genes and the rfp gene of shigella dysenteriae 1 in generation of lipopolysaccharide core heterogeneity and attachment of o antigen.,"role of escherichia coli k-12 rfa genes and the rfp gene of shigella dysenteriae 1 in generation of lipopolysaccharide core heterogeneity and attachment of o antigen.. The rfp gene of Shigella dysenteriae 1 and the rfa genes of Escherichia coli K-12 and Salmonella typhimurium LT2 have been studied to determine their relationship to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) core heterogeneity and their role in the attachment of O antigen to LPS. It has been inferred from the nucleotide sequence that the rfp gene encodes a protein of 41,864 Da which has a structure similar to that of RfaG protein. Expression of this gene in E. coli K-12 results in the loss of one of the three bands seen in gel analysis of the LPS and in the appearance of a new, more slowly migrating band. This is consistent with the hypothesis that Rfp is a sugar transferase which modifies a subset of core molecules so that they become substrates for attachment of S. dysenteriae O antigen. A shift in gel migration of the bands carrying S. dysenteriae O antigen and disappearance of the Rfp-modified band in strains producing O antigen suggest that the core may be trimmed or modified further before attachment of O antigen. Mutation of rfaL results in a loss of the rough LPS band which appears to be modified by Rfp and prevents the appearance of the Rfp-modified band. Thus, RfaL protein is involved in core modification and is more than just a component of the O-antigen ligase. The products of rfaK and rfaQ also appear to be involved in modification of the core prior to attachment of O antigen, and the sites of rfaK modification are different in E. coli K-12 and S. typhimurium. In contrast, mutations in rfaS and rfaZ result in changes in the LPS core but do not affect the attachment of O antigen. We propose that these genes are involved in an alternative pathway for the synthesis of rough LPS species which are similar to lipooligosaccharides of other species and which are not substrates for O-antigen attachment. All of these studies indicate that the apparent heterogeneity of E. coli K-12 LPS observed on gels is not an artifact but instead a reflection of functional differences among LPS species.",1992

s16425,characterization of a salmonella typhimurium aro vaccine strain expressing the p.69 antigen of bordetella pertussis.,"characterization of a salmonella typhimurium aro vaccine strain expressing the p.69 antigen of bordetella pertussis.. The P.69 Bordetella pertussis protective antigen was expressed by use of the trc promoter from the chromosome of a Salmonella typhimurium aro vaccine strain, BRD509, by integrating the prn gene, encoding the 93-kDa precursor of this protein, into the aroC locus. P.69 was detected on the cell surface of the S. typhimurium strain (BRD640) by agglutination and immunoelectron microscopy. BALB/c mice immunized orally or intravenously with BRD640 showed a significant level of protection against an aerosol challenge with virulent B. pertussis, compared with control animals. No anti-P.69 antibodies in the serum or anti-P.69 antibody-secreting cells in the lungs were detected in BRD640-vaccinated animals, although cells isolated from spleens showed a P.69-dependent cell proliferative response. In contrast, low levels of anti-P.69 antibodies in the serum and anti-P.69 antibody-secreting cells in the lungs were detected in immunized mice following a B. pertussis challenge.",1992
s16603,clonal expansion in follicular lymphoma occurs subsequent to antigenic selection.,"clonal expansion in follicular lymphoma occurs subsequent to antigenic selection.. The genesis of human follicular lymphoma (FL) is a multistep process. The initial event is thought to be the chromosomal translocation t(14;18)(q32;q21) juxtaposing the bcl-2 proto-oncogene with the immunoglobulin (Ig) H chain locus joining segment (JH) as an error of D-J or V-D joining in the pre-B cell. However, FL is recognized clinically as a tumor of surface Ig (sIg)-positive B cells with morphologic and phenotypic similarities to the centrocyte of the secondary immune response. Thus, additional steps must be involved in the clonal expansion of the FL tumor cell beyond the activation of bcl-2 as a consequence of the t(14;18) translocation. Like the normal centrocyte, somatic mutations accumulate in the variable (V) genes of FL tumor B cells. To determine if clonal expansion of FL occurs before or after the development of the malignant follicle, we sought to examine the evolution of the FL V gene from its unmutated germline (GL) counterpart. To obtain the GL gene we first cloned the productively rearranged V gene of patient MT FL and obtained the clone rMTF. A hybridization probe derived from the 2.1-kb region upstream of the V gene in clone rMTF identified a single band in Southern blot hybridization of GL DNA. This probe was used to screen a size-selected library, and candidate GL V genes were isolated. Two identical clones, MTGL1 and 2, proved to have upstream regions (USRs) that were colinear with the USR of the rMTF. Thus, the MTGL clones represent the unmutated GL V genes, which were productively rearranged in the MT FL. Comparison of the GL V gene sequence to a consensus of MT FL V gene sequences revealed 42 mutations, demonstrating that malignant clonal expansion occurred subsequent to the activation of somatic mutation, presumably in the malignant follicle. Furthermore, the individual FL V gene sequences segregated into two distinct patterns of mutation. The major population represented 71% of the clones, and the minor population 29%. To investigate possible mechanisms for the parallel selection of distinct tumor cell populations, we analyzed the pattern of silent and replacement mutations within the V gene sequences. We found that in the framework regions (FRs) of both populations there were significantly fewer replacement changes than expected, suggesting that negative selective pressure was maintaining the structural integrity of the sIg. In contrast, the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), which make up the antigen binding domain of Ig, had an excess of replacement changes, suggesting positive selection for altered ligand binding.",1992
s16615,a nonapeptide encoded by human gene mage-1 is recognized on hla-a1 by cytolytic t lymphocytes directed against tumor antigen mz2-e.,"a nonapeptide encoded by human gene mage-1 is recognized on hla-a1 by cytolytic t lymphocytes directed against tumor antigen mz2-e.. We have reported the identification of human gene MAGE-1, which directs the expression of an antigen recognized on a melanoma by autologous cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL). We show here that CTL directed against this antigen, which was named MZ2-E, recognize a nonapeptide encoded by the third exon of gene MAGE-1. The CTL also recognize this peptide when it is presented by mouse cells transfected with an HLA-A1 gene, confirming the association of antigen MZ2-E with the HLA-A1 molecule. Other members of the MAGE gene family do not code for the same peptide, suggesting that only MAGE-1 produces the antigen recognized by the anti-MZ2-E CTL. Our results open the possibility of immunizing HLA-A1 patients whose tumor expresses MAGE-1 either with the antigenic peptide or with autologous antigen-presenting cells pulsed with the peptide.",1992

The antigenic and genetic characteristics of the haemagglutinins of influenza type B viruses isolated since 1988 during periods of both widespread activity (1990/1991) and sporadic activity (1989/1990) were examined using microneutralization tests and direct RNA sequencing. During 1989/1990, influenza B viruses representative of two distinct lineages antigenically and genetically related to either B/Victoria/2/87 or B/Yamagata/16/88 were isolated, and a minor drift variant of B/Yamagata/16/88, B/Hong Kong/22/89, was identified. In 1990/1991, B/Hong Kong/22/89- or B/Yamagata/16/88-like viruses accounted for the majority of the influenza virus isolates in most countries. Sequence analysis of the HA1 domains of representative viruses confirmed the continued existence of two main lineages among recent strains of influenza B virus and identified unique amino acid changes that could account for the altered antigenic reactivity of some variants. Sequence analysis of the HA2 domains of some of the recent influenza B viruses allowed for a comparison of the evolutionary rates and patterns between the HA1 and HA2 domains.",1992

RNA purified from the feline calicivirus (FCV) F9 vaccine strain was used to prepare a cDNA library in the expression vector lambda gt11. The library was screened for expression of FCV antigen using a rabbit antiserum prepared against purified FCV. A 330 bp cDNA clone was identified and used as a probe to obtain a larger overlapping clone of 1369 bp. Comparative sequence analysis with the CFI and F4 strains showed that the clones were derived from the 3' open reading frame encoding the capsid protein. The region encoded by the 330 bp clone was shown to be variable in the three strains compared, and therefore the probable location of major antigenic variation. This clone was expressed in a bacterial system and antiserum to the recombinant protein was used in immunoblots to confirm that this clone was derived from the gene encoding the capsid protein. From these immunoblots, several other capsid-related polypeptides were identified. Comparison with immunoblots using post-vaccination cat sera showed the antibody response in the cat was directed mainly against the capsid protein. Antiserum to the recombinant protein was shown to be effective in neutralizing the infectivity of FCV, indicating that at least one major neutralizing epitope had been cloned.",1992
s17038,molecular definition of tumor antigens recognized by t lymphocytes.,"molecular definition of tumor antigens recognized by t lymphocytes.. Several tumor antigens recognized by T cells have now been identified at the molecular level. Various mechanisms can account for their expression: activation of normally silent genes; point mutations; chromosome translocations; and post-translational modifications of proteins. This led to the notion that potential tumor-rejection antigens can be shared by a significant proportion of human tumors. This may have important implications in cancer immunotherapy, especially since tumors expressing a defined antigen can be identified on the basis of the expression of the relevant gene.",1992
s17230,identification of tumour rejection antigens recognized by t lymphocytes.,"identification of tumour rejection antigens recognized by t lymphocytes.. On the basis of the results reviewed here, there are two major mechanisms whereby tumour rejection antigens may arise. The first mechanism is mutational. Point mutations occurring in a large variety of genes may produce new antigenic peptides, either by providing them with the ability to bind to MHC class I molecules or by providing them with a new epitope (Fig. 2). The second mechanism is the activation of a gene that is silent in normal tissues and for which no strong natural tolerance has been established. Plausible candidates for the mutational mechanism are the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""tumour specific transplantation antigens"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" observed on methylcholanthrene induced tumours and tumours induced by ultraviolet light. The diversity of these antigens appears to be very large, like that of the tum- antigens. Moreover, these tumours have been obtained with high doses of carcinogens, which are proven mutagens. On the other hand, a P815 tumour rejection antigen appears to arise through the activation of a silent gene, and it may turn out that this is the rule for most tumour rejection antigens. It is our hope that other genes coding for mouse and human tumour rejection antigens will soon be identified, so that it will become clear whether the activational mechanism is the rule or the exception. In our view, this is a crucial issue. Insofar as tumour rejection antigens result from mutations, they may be highly specific for every individual tumour. The tumour specific nature of these antigens would then be easily ascertained. However, active immunization of cancer patients would require that a tumour cell line be obtained from each patient, a most unpractical prospect. If, on the other hand, production of tumour rejection antigens results from the activation of a normal gene, then there is a good probability that the same gene may be activated in many different tumours, being perhaps preferentially shared by tumours of the same histological type. This would probably not result in the expression of the same antigen in all these tumours, because the patients would differ in their presenting molecules, which are determined by their HLA haplotype.

s17665,"large, identical, tandem repeating units in the c protein alpha antigen gene, bca, of group b streptococci.","large, identical, tandem repeating units in the c protein alpha antigen gene, bca, of group b streptococci.. Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in the United States. The surface-associated C protein alpha antigen of GBS is thought to have a role in both virulence and immunity. We previously cloned the C protein alpha antigen structural gene (named bca for group B, C protein, alpha) into Escherichia coli. Western blots of both the native alpha antigen and the cloned gene product demonstrate a regularly laddered pattern of heterogeneous polypeptides. The nucleotide sequence of the bca locus reveals an open reading frame of 3060 nucleotides encoding a precursor protein of 108,705 Da. Cleavage of a putative signal sequence of 41 amino acids yields a mature protein of 104,106 Da. The 20,417-Da N-terminal region of the alpha antigen shows no homology to previously described protein sequences and is followed by a series of nine tandem repeating units that make up 74% of the mature protein. Each repeating unit is identical and consists of 82 amino acids with a molecular mass of 8665 Da, which is encoded by 246 nucleotides. The size of the repeating units corresponds to the observed size differences in the heterogeneous ladder of alpha C proteins expressed by GBS. The C-terminal region of the alpha antigen contains a membrane anchor domain motif that is shared by a number of Gram-positive surface proteins. The large region of identical repeating units in bca defines protective epitopes and may play a role in generating phenotypic and genotypic diversity of the alpha antigen.",1992
s17673,anthrax toxin protective antigen is activated by a cell surface protease with the sequence specificity and catalytic properties of furin.,"anthrax toxin protective antigen is activated by a cell surface protease with the sequence specificity and catalytic properties of furin.. Proteolytic cleavage of the protective antigen (PA) protein of anthrax toxin at residues 164-167 is necessary for toxic activity. Cleavage by a cellular protease at this sequence, Arg-Lys-Lys-Arg, normally follows binding of PA to a cell surface receptor. We attempted to identify this protease by determining its sequence specificity and catalytic properties. Semi-random cassette mutagenesis was used to generate mutants with replacements of residues 164-167 by Arg, Lys, Ser, or Asn. Analysis of 19 mutant proteins suggested that lethal factor-dependent toxicity required the sequence Arg-Xaa-Xaa-Arg. Based on these data, three additional mutants were constructed with the sequences Ala-Lys-Lys-Arg, Arg-Lys-Lys-Ala, and Arg-Ala-Ala-Arg. Of these mutant proteins, Arg-Ala-Ala-Arg was toxic, confirming that the cellular protease can recognize the sequence Arg-Xaa-Xaa-Arg. The mutant containing the sequence Ala-Lys-Lys-Arg was also toxic but required > 13 times more protein to produce equivalent toxicity. This sequence specificity is similar to that of the ubiquitous subtilisin-like protease furin, which is involved in processing of precursors of certain receptors and growth factors. Therefore we tested whether a recombinant soluble furin would cleave PA. This furin derivative efficiently cleaved native PA and the Arg-Ala-Ala-Arg mutant but not the nontoxic PA mutants. In addition, previously identified inhibitors of furin blocked cleavage of receptor-bound PA. These data imply that furin is the cellular protease that activates PA, and that nearly all cell types contain at least a small amount of furin exposed on their cell surface.",1992

The construction and characterization of EcSf2a-2, an aroD-deleted Escherichia coli-Shigella hybrid vaccine carrying chromosomal and plasmid genes from Shigella flexneri and expressing S. flexneri 2a somatic antigen in association with E. coli K12 core are described. Expression of hybrid lipopolysaccharide and deletion of aroD resulted in the attenuation of phenotypic characteristics associated with pathogenicity. The addition of an aroD deletion results in a requirement for an aromatic precursor of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), an essential bacterial metabolite not present in mammalian tissues. The biosynthesis of hybrid somatic antigen prevents expression of a Sereny-positive reaction by invasive bacteria capable of expressing a plaque-positive phenotype. A functional kcpA gene is required for expression of the plaque-positive phenotype. The presence of an aroD deletion does not interfere with expression of an invasive phenotype; however, in bacteria containing a functional kcpA gene, replication and spread by invading bacteria are limited, preventing development of the plaque-positive phenotype.",1992
s17982,hla-dr molecules from an antigen-processing mutant cell line are associated with invariant chain peptides.,"hla-dr molecules from an antigen-processing mutant cell line are associated with invariant chain peptides.. The invariant chain, which associates with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum, serves two functions important in antigen processing. First, it prevents class II molecules from binding peptides in the early stages of intracellular transport. Second, it contains a cytoplasmic signal that targets the class II-invariant chain complex to an acidic endosomal compartment. Proteolytic cleavage and subsequent dissociation of the invariant chain then occurs, allowing peptides derived from endocytosed proteins to bind to released class II molecules before their expression at the cell surface. Certain human cell lines that are mutant in one or more MHC-linked genes are defective in class II-restricted antigen processing. Here we show that in transfectants of one of these cell lines, T2, this deficiency results in the association of a large proportion of class II molecules with a nested set of invariant-chain-derived peptides (class II-associated invariant chain peptides, or CLIP). HLA-DR3 molecules isolated from T2 transfectants can be efficiently loaded with antigenic peptides by exposure to a low pH in vitro, perhaps reflecting the in vivo conditions in which peptides associate with class II molecules. Addition of synthetic CLIP inhibits the loading process, indicating that CLIP may define the region of the invariant chain responsible for obstructing the class II binding site.",1992
s18091,dna sequence analysis of 66 kb of the human mhc class ii region encoding a cluster of genes for antigen processing.,"dna sequence analysis of 66 kb of the human mhc class ii region encoding a cluster of genes for antigen processing.. The genomic sequence of a 66,109 bp long region within the human MHC has been determined by manual and automated DNA sequencing. From cDNA mapping and sequencing data it is known that this region contains a cluster of at least four genes that are believed to be involved in antigen processing. Here, we describe the genomic organization of these genes, which comprise two proteasome-related genes (LMP2 and LMP7), thought to be involved in the proteolytic degradation of cytoplasmic antigens and two ABC transporter genes (TAP1 and TAP2), thought to be involved in pumping of the degraded peptides across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Analysis of the sequence homology and the intron/exon structures of the corresponding genes suggests that one gene pair arose by duplication from the other. Comparison of the available sequence data from other organisms shows striking conservation (70 to 84%) of this gene cluster in human, mouse and rat. The presence of several potential interferon stimulated response elements (ISREs) is in agreement with the experimentally observed up-regulation of these genes with gamma-interferon.",1992
s18197,"studies on processing, particle formation, and immunogenicity of the hiv-1 gag gene product: a possible component of a hiv vaccine.","studies on processing, particle formation, and immunogenicity of the hiv-1 gag gene product: a possible component of a hiv vaccine.. Antigens in a particulate conformation were shown to be highly immunogenic in mammals. For this reason, the particle forming capacity of derivatives of the HIV-1 group specific core antigen p55 gag was assayed and compared dependent on various expression systems: recombinant bacteria, vaccinia- and baculoviruses were established encoding the entire core protein p55 either in its authentic sequence or lacking the myristylation consensus signal. Moreover, p55 gag was expressed in combination with the protease (p55-PR) or with the entire polymerase (p55-pol), respectively. Budding of 100-160 nm p55 core particles, resembling immature HIV-virions, was observed in the eucaryotic expression systems only. In comparison to the vaccinia virus driven expression of p55 in mammalian cells, considerably higher yields of particulate core antigen were obtained by infection of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells with the recombinant Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis (AcMNPV) baculovirus. Mutation of the NH2-terminal myristylation signal sequence prevented budding of the immature core particles. Expression of the HIV p55-PR gene construct by recombinant baculovirus resulted in complete processing of the p55 gag precursor molecule in this system. The introduction of an artificial frameshift near the natural frameshift site resulted in constitutive expression of the viral protease and complete processing of p55, both in Escherichia coli and in vaccinia virus infected cells. Interestingly, significant processing of p55 resembling that of HIV infected H9 cells could also be achieved in the vaccinia system by fusing the entire pol gene to the gag gene. Moreover, processing was not found to be dependent on amino-terminal myristylation of the gag procursor molecule, which is in contrast to observations with type C and type D retrovirus. However, complete processing of p55 into p24, p17, p9 and p6 abolished particle formation. Purified immature HIV-virus like particles were highly immunogenic in rabbits, leading to a strong humoral immune response after immunization. Empty immature p55 gag particles represent a noninfectious and attractive candidate for a basic vaccine component.",1992

When a new strain of an influenza virus is required to be incorporated into influenza vaccine, attempts are made to recombine such strains with laboratory adapted viruses, which will grow to high titre in order to improve the yield of the vaccine strain. It is important that such high growth reassortant vaccine strains are not contaminated with genes coding for the antigenic determinants of the high growth laboratory strain. We describe the characterization of two recent high growth reassortants and the application of the polymerase chain reaction to ensure their genetic identity and purity.",1992
s18249,immunogenicity and safety of a recombinant vaccinia virus vaccine expressing the carcinoembryonic antigen gene in a nonhuman primate.,"immunogenicity and safety of a recombinant vaccinia virus vaccine expressing the carcinoembryonic antigen gene in a nonhuman primate.. We have previously reported the development of a recombinant vaccinia virus vaccine expressing the human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene, designated rV(NYC)-CEA. This construct has been shown to elicit specific anti-CEA immune responses and an antitumor effect in a murine tumor model. In the studies reported here, the safety and immunogenicity of this recombinant vaccinia virus were evaluated in a rhesus monkey model. Human CEA is a M(r) 180,000 glycoprotein expressed in approximately 90% of gastrointestinal carcinomas and in some breast and non-small cell lung carcinomas. This family also includes normal cross-reacting antigen (NCA). Rhesus monkeys, like humans, have some NCA on the surface of their granulocytes. Eight monkeys were immunized 3 or 4 times by skin scarification with the recombinant CEA vaccine and four monkeys received wild-type vaccinia virus as control. After three vaccinations, all rV(NYC)-CEA-vaccinated animals exhibited a strong anti-CEA antibody response as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The functional ability of these antibodies to mediate lysis of a CEA-bearing tumor cell was demonstrated using human effector cells. This response could be enhanced by interleukin 2. Cellular immunity to CEA was measured by delayed-type hypersensitivity upon intradermal challenge with purified CEA. Only those animals receiving the recombinant vaccine displayed significant anti-CEA responses. Furthermore, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from immunized monkeys were found to proliferate in response to CEA stimulation. All vaccinated monkeys developed local skin irritation at the site of the vaccination, regional lymphadenopathy, and low-grade fevers after immunization. Following immunization with rV(NYC)-CEA, the response was consistent with the usual constitutional symptoms seen with human smallpox virus immunization. Blood counts, differentials, and hepatic and renal chemistries remained normal in all animals throughout the study and for up to 1 year following the primary vaccination. No evidence of immunological cross-reactivity to NCA was found by either a fall in the granulocyte count or analyses for anti-NCA antibodies. Thus, the rV(NYC)-CEA vaccine appears to be safe in rhesus monkeys. The administration of a CEA recombinant vaccine to rhesus monkeys induces both a humoral and a cell-mediated immune response directed against human CEA.",1992
s18328,comparative clonal analysis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1)-specific cd4+ and cd8+ cytolytic t lymphocytes isolated from seronegative humans immunized with candidate hiv-1 vaccines.,"comparative clonal analysis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1)-specific cd4+ and cd8+ cytolytic t lymphocytes isolated from seronegative humans immunized with candidate hiv-1 vaccines.. The lysis of infected host cells by virus-specific cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) is an important factor in host resistance to viral infection. An optimal vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) would elicit virus-specific CTL as well as neutralizing antibodies. The induction by a vaccine of HIV-1-specific CD8+ CTL in humans has not been previously reported. In this study, CTL responses were evaluated in HIV-1-seronegative human volunteers participating in a phase I acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) vaccine trial involving a novel vaccine regimen. Volunteers received an initial immunization with a live recombinant vaccinia virus vector carrying the HIV-1 env gene and a subsequent boost with purified env protein. An exceptionally strong env-specific CTL response was detected in one of two vaccine recipients, while modest but significant env-specific CTL activity was present in the second vaccinee. Cloning of the responding CTL gave both CD4+ and CD8+ env-specific CTL clones, permitting a detailed comparison of critical functional properties of these two types of CTL. In particular, the potential antiviral effects of these CTL were evaluated in an in vitro system involving HIV-1 infection of cultures of normal autologous CD4+ lymphoblasts. At extremely low effector-to-target ratios, vaccine-induced CD8+ CTL clones lysed productively infected cells present within these cultures. When tested for lytic activity against target cells expressing the HIV-1 env gene, CD8+ CTL were 3-10-fold more active on a per cell basis than CD4+ CTL. However, when tested against autologous CD4+ lymphoblasts acutely infected with HIV-1, CD4+ clones lysed a much higher fraction of the target cell population than did CD8+ CTL. CD4+ CTL were shown to recognize not only the infected cells within these acutely infected cultures but also noninfected CD4+ T cells that had passively taken up gp120 shed from infected cells and/or free virions. These results were confirmed in studies in which CD4+ lymphoblasts were exposed to recombinant gp120 and used as targets for gp120-specific CD4+ and CD8+ CTL clones. gp120-pulsed, noninfected targets were lysed in an antigen-specific fashion by CD4+ but not CD8+ CTL clones. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that in an in vitro HIV-1 infection, sufficient amounts of gp120 antigen are produced and shed by infected cells to enable uptake by cells that are not yet infected, resulting in the lysis of these noninfected cells by gp120-specific, CD4+ CTL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1992
s18370,identification of immunodominant antigens during infection with mycobacterium tuberculosis.,"identification of immunodominant antigens during infection with mycobacterium tuberculosis.. T lymphocytes isolated from mice infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis response vigorously to proteins secreted by the bacilli and these antigens may be of importance in the generation of protective immunity against the disease. In this study, short-term culture filtrate (ST-CF), which constitutes a complex mixture of secreted proteins, was fractionated by a modified preparative SDS-PAGE technique. The ability of each fraction to be recognized by T cells isolated from infected mice was evaluated by quantifying proliferation and IFN-gamma production in cell cultures. Two molecular mass regions 4-11 and 26-35 kDa were found to possess marked stimulatory properties. Four potent single antigens were mapped within the stimulatory regions. These purified antigens stimulated T cells isolated from mice at the height of a tuberculous infection to produce large amounts of IFN-gamma. Two of these stimulatory antigens belonged to the antigen 85 complex.",1992
s18474,expression of hepatitis b surface antigen in transgenic plants.,"expression of hepatitis b surface antigen in transgenic plants.. Tobacco plants were genetically transformed with the gene encoding hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) linked to a nominally constitutive promoter. Enzyme-linked immunoassays using a monoclonal antibody directed against human serum-derived HBsAg revealed the presence of HBsAg in extracts of transformed leaves at levels that correlated with mRNA abundance. This suggests that there were no major inherent limitations of transcription or translation of this foreign gene in plants. Recombinant HBsAg was purified from transgenic plants by immunoaffinity chromatography and examined by electron microscopy. Spherical particles with an average diameter of 22 nm were observed in negatively stained preparations. Sedimentation of transgenic plant extracts in sucrose and cesium chloride density gradients showed that the recombinant HBsAg and human serum-derived HBsAg had similar physical properties. Because the HBsAg produced in transgenic plants is antigenically and physically similar to the HBsAg particles derived from human serum and recombinant yeast, which are used as vaccines, we conclude that transgenic plants hold promise as low-cost vaccine production systems.",1992
s18623,protective effects of a live attenuated siv vaccine with a deletion in the nef gene.,"protective effects of a live attenuated siv vaccine with a deletion in the nef gene.. Vaccine protection against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the related simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in animal models is proving to be a difficult task. The difficulty is due in large part to the persistent, unrelenting nature of HIV and SIV infection once infection is initiated. SIV with a constructed deletion in the auxiliary gene nef replicates poorly in rhesus monkeys and appears to be nonpathogenic in this normally susceptible host. Rhesus monkeys vaccinated with live SIV deleted in nef were completely protected against challenge by intravenous inoculation of live, pathogenic SIV. Deletion of nef or of multiple genetic elements from HIV may provide the means for creating a safe, effective, live attenuated vaccine to protect against acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).",1992

The development is outlined of some synthetic vaccines against infectious diseases, in particular cholera, shigella and influenza. In the last case, use of the synthetic adjuvant MDP in combination with a haemagglutinin peptide has led to a synthetic vaccine with built-in adjuvanticity. The production of vaccines both by chemical synthesis and genetic engineering is described. The successful use of the synthetic amino acid copolymer COP-1 as an immunomodulatory vaccine to suppress the onset of allergic encephalomyelitis in experimental animals has led to clinical trials with patients suffering from exacerbating remitting multiple sclerosis. T-cell vaccination is an alternative approach to immunization against autoimmune diseases.",1992
s18725,molecular analysis of the aroa gene of pasteurella multocida and vaccine potential of a constructed aroa mutant.,"molecular analysis of the aroa gene of pasteurella multocida and vaccine potential of a constructed aroa mutant.. The aroA gene from Pasteurella multocida was cloned by complementation of the Escherichia coli aroA mutant AB2829 with a DNA library constructed in pUC18. The nucleotide sequence of the P. multocida aroA gene indicated an open reading frame encoding a protein of 441 amino acids, which showed a high degree of homology with the amino acid sequences of various other bacterial AroA proteins. The cloned P. multocida aroA gene was inactivated by insertion of a kanamycin-resistance gene and reintroduced by allelic exchange into the chromosome of P. multocida using the suicide vector pJM703.1. The P. multocida aroA mutant was highly attenuated in a mouse model. Mice immunized intraperitoneally with two doses of live P. multocida aroA mutant were completely protected against a lethal parental strain challenge.",1992
s18893,the antigen 85 complex: a major secretion product of mycobacterium tuberculosis.,"the antigen 85 complex: a major secretion product of mycobacterium tuberculosis.. The large number of different proteins synthesized by the mycobacterial cell are currently classified and studied in terms of groups of proteins with certain common properties such as physical and chemical characteristics, function, and localization in the mycobacterial cell. Proteins that are actively secreted during culture on synthetic media represent a particular group of great current interest. At least eight proteins secreted by Mycobacterium tuberculosis have been isolated and characterized to various extents. The genes coding for five proteins secreted from M. tuberculosis and/or Mycobacterium bovis BCG have been cloned and sequenced. All of them contain typical signal sequences. The proteins of the antigen 85 complex, which form the main subject of this review, are often the most common proteins in M. tuberculosis culture fluid. The constituents denoted 85A, 85B, and 85C are encoded by three genes located at different sites in the mycobacterial genome and show extensive cross-reactivity as well as homology at amino acid and gene levels. The proteins differ slightly in molecular mass in the 30- to 31-kDa region, and all of them are fibronectin-binding proteins, but the significance of the latter observation and the role of these proteins in mycobacterial physiology and interaction with the infected host remain to be elucidated. The antigen 85 complex proteins are strongly immunogenic in natural and experimental mycobacterial infections in terms of both induction of antibody synthesis and T-cell-mediated reactions. The well-recognized difference in the efficacy of live and dead mycobacterial vaccines should be considered in relation to the group of secreted antigens. After inoculation, live bacteria in vaccines such as BCG multiply in the host, probably releasing several constituents belonging to the class of secreted proteins and hence resulting in more efficient stimulation of the immune system. Secreted mycobacterial antigens are expected to be of particular significance in induction of various immune responses that are responsible for development of protective immunity in some individuals and for clinical symptoms and complications of the ensuing disease in others.",1992
s18984,protection of chickens from newcastle and marek's diseases with a recombinant herpesvirus of turkeys vaccine expressing the newcastle disease virus fusion protein.,"protection of chickens from newcastle and marek's diseases with a recombinant herpesvirus of turkeys vaccine expressing the newcastle disease virus fusion protein.. Recombinant strains of herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) were constructed that contain either the fusion protein gene or the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase gene of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) inserted into a nonessential gene of HVT. Expression of the NDV antigens was regulated from a strong promoter element derived from the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat. Recombinant HVT strains were stable and fully infectious in cell culture and in chickens. Chickens receiving a single intra-abdominal inoculation at 1 day of age with recombinant HVT expressing the NDV fusion protein had an immunological response and were protected (> 90%) against lethal intramuscular challenge at 28 days of age with the neurotropic velogenic NDV strain Texas GB. Recombinant HVT expressing the NDV hemagglutinin-neuraminidase provided partial protection (47%) against the same challenge. Chickens vaccinated with recombinant HVT vaccines had low levels of protection against NDV replication in the trachea when challenged ocularly. Recombinant HVT vaccines and the parent HVT strain provided similar levels of protection to chickens challenged with the very virulent RB1B strain of Marek's disease virus, indicating that insertion of foreign sequences into the HVT genome did not compromise the ability of HVT to protect against Marek's disease.",1992
s19150,clonal evolution of a follicular lymphoma: evidence for antigen selection.,"clonal evolution of a follicular lymphoma: evidence for antigen selection.. The potential role antigens play in growth stimulation or in clonal selection of follicular lymphomas is unknown. To study this issue, we sequenced the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes expressed by a follicular lymphoma from multiple biopsy specimens and also cloned and sequenced the corresponding germ-line variable gene from this patient. Comparison to the germ-line gene revealed numerous nucleotide substitutions in all of the lymphoma variable gene sequences. Some of the substitutions may have occurred in the nonmalignant precursor B cell that gave rise to this lymphoma because they were shared among all of the variable genes, but many of the mutations accumulated as the malignant clone expanded. The mutations were distributed in such a way that strongly suggested the majority of tumor cells had been positively selected through their antigen receptor. This was especially evident for the mutations that developed late in the clonal evolution of this lymphoma. These findings indicate that antigen stimulation may be involved in the growth of follicular lymphoma tumors.",1992
s19262,molecular analysis of the serotyping antigens of neisseria meningitidis.,"molecular analysis of the serotyping antigens of neisseria meningitidis.. Molecular approaches to the rapid analysis of the serotyping antigens of Neisseria meningitidis, the class 2 and 3 outer membrane proteins (OMPs), were developed, evaluated, and used to study 12 antigenic variants of these proteins. A primer set for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the genes encoding these antigens was devised. Low-stringency amplification of meningococcal chromosomal DNA with this primer set resulted in the amplification of two products from each strain, whereas at higher stringencies only one product was amplified in most strains. Southern hybridization techniques and restriction analyses were used to differentiate the PCR products amplified at high stringencies from strains expressing class 2 or class 3 OMPs; these PCR products were further characterized by the determination of their nucleotide sequences, confirming that they represented the amplified class 2 and class 3 OMP genes. Analyses of these and other nucleotide sequences enabled the construction of a phenogram illustrating the interrelationships between Neisseria OMP genes. The comparative analysis of deduced amino acid sequences revealed conserved and variable regions of the proteins; the latter probably correspond to surface loops on the protein and hence are potentially exposed to the immune system. Further analyses of the primary structures of these related porins from Neisseria species enabled construction of models of the secondary structure of these antigens and comparison of these models with those previously published. The methods reported in the present work are rapid reproducible procedures for the analysis of antigenic variants of these proteins.",1992
s19266,recombinant salmonella typhimurium strains that invade nonphagocytic cells are resistant to recognition by antigen-specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes.,"recombinant salmonella typhimurium strains that invade nonphagocytic cells are resistant to recognition by antigen-specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes.. To address the question of whether Salmonella-infected nonphagocytic cells could serve as target cells for recognition by antigen-specific, major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), four recombinant Salmonella typhimurium constructs that expressed full-length, or fragments of, influenza A virus nucleoprotein (NP) were made. The bacteria were shown to infect Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Appropriate major histocompatibility complex restriction molecules, HLA-B27 and H-2 Db, were transfected into CHO cells, which were then infected with recombinant S. typhimurium and used as targets for NP-specific CTL. The cells in which NP was expressed by intracellularly replicating bacteria were not lysed by NP-specific CTL, although they were killed when appropriate influenza A virus or peptides were used. Thus, S.typhimurium bacteria within nonphagocytic cells were resistant to CTL recognition. In contrast to these results, mice infected with recombinant S.typhimurium that expressed fragments of NP in the periplasm were primed for NP-specific CTL responses. The results indicate that CTL responses specific to Salmonella antigens can be generated, but the bacteria may be safe from the CTL attack once they have entered the nonphagocytic cells.",1992
s19661,functional characterization of protease-treated bacillus anthracis protective antigen.,"functional characterization of protease-treated bacillus anthracis protective antigen.. Characterization of the functional domains of Bacillus anthracis protective antigen (PA, 83-kDa), the common cellular binding molecule for both anthrax edema toxin and anthrax lethal toxin, is important for understanding the mechanism of entry and action of the anthrax toxins. In this study, we generated both biologically active (facilitates killing of J774A.1 cells in combination with lethal factor, LF) and inactive preparations of PA by protease treatment. Limited proteolytic digestion of PA in vitro with trypsin generated a 20-kDa fragment and a biologically active 63-kDa fragment. In contrast, limited digestion of PA with chymotrypsin yielded a preparation containing 37- and 47-kDa fragments defective for biological activity. Treatment with both chymotrypsin and trypsin generated three major fragments, 20, """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""17,"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and 47 kDa as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This PA preparation was also biologically inactive. To investigate the nature of the defect resulting from chymotrypsin treatment, we assayed PA preparations for the ability to bind to the cellular receptor and to bind and internalize 125I-LF. All radiolabeled PA preparations bound with specificity to J774A.1 cells and exhibited affinities similar to native 83-kDa PA. Once bound to the cell surface receptor, both trypsin-treated PA and chymotrypsin/trypsin-treated PA specifically bound 125I-LF with high affinity. Finally, these PA preparations delivered 125I-LF to a Pronase-resistant cellular compartment in a time- and temperature-dependent fashion. Thus, the biological defect exhibited by chymotrypsin-treated PA is not at the level of cell binding or internalization but at a step later, such as toxin routing or processing by J774A.1 cells. These protease-treated preparations of PA should prove useful in both elucidating the intracellular processing of anthrax lethal toxin and determining the structure-function relationship of PA and LF.",1992
s19677,generation and analysis of random point mutations in an antibody cdr2 sequence: many mutated antibodies lose their ability to bind antigen.,"generation and analysis of random point mutations in an antibody cdr2 sequence: many mutated antibodies lose their ability to bind antigen.. We have investigated the impact of mutations on the binding functions of the phosphocholine (PC)-specific T15 antibody in the absence of antigen selection pressure. The H chain complementarity determining region 2 (CDR2) sequence of T15 antibody was saturated with point mutations by in vitro random mutagenesis. From the mutant library, 289 clones were screened by direct DNA sequencing. The point mutations generated by this method were randomly distributed throughout the CDR2 region and included all kinds of substitutions. 46 unique mutant antibodies, containing one to four point mutations each, were expressed in SP2/0 myeloma cells. Functional analysis on these antibodies has provided insights into several aspects of somatic mutation. (a) The majority (26/46) of mutant antibodies either lost (20/46) or had reduced (6/46) ability to bind PC-protein conjugates or R36a, a PC-expressing strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae. In contrast, none of the mutant antibodies displayed increased binding for these PC antigens. Taken together with calculations of destructive mutations elsewhere in the V region, the data suggest that somatic mutation may cause extensive wastage among B cells during clonal expansion after antigen stimulation. (b) The frequency of binding-loss mutants increased sharply when a second mutation was introduced into the CDR2 sequence; it appears that, in some cases, two or more mutations are needed to destroy binding. (c) The mutant antibodies were tested for their reactivity to 11 non-PC antigens as well as to three PC analogues. None of the mutants gained new reactivity or changed their ability to discriminate structural analogues, supporting the notion that the major role of somatic mutation is to increase or decrease affinity rather than to create new specificities. (d) Mutations in at least five different positions in CDR2 were deleterious, suggesting that these residues may be essential for antigen binding. Three of these positions are novel in that they had not been identified to be important for binding PC by previous crystallographic analysis. (e) Introduction of mutations into two highly conserved residues in CDR2 did not alter the overall conformation of the V region as judged by antiidiotypic analysis, and, in some cases, did not affect the antigen binding function. The results thus indicate that even nonconservative substitutions of invariant residues need not be deleterious, suggesting that their conservation may be due to reasons other than maintaining antibody structure or specificity.",1992

Recombinant adenovirus type 4, 5, and 7 expressing the fusion glycoprotein (F) gene, the attachment glycoprotein (G) gene, or both F and G genes of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was constructed. Intratracheal immunization of dogs with Ad7F induced moderate titers of RSV-neutralizing antibodies. After booster immunization with Ad4F, the dogs developed high titers of RSV-specific antibody. Subsequently, three two-dose vaccination regimens, Ad4F/Ad5F, Ad7G/Ad4G, and Ad7FG/Ad4FG, were compared with Ad7F/Ad4F for immunogenicity and protective efficacy. The results indicated that Ad4F/Ad5F was equal or greater in immunogenicity to Ad7F/Ad4F, but Ad7G/Ad4G and Ad7FG/Ad4FG were less effective than Ad7F/Ad4F in inducing RSV-neutralizing antibody. All vaccination regimens completely protected the lungs of dogs from RSV infection. A chimpanzee was sequentially immunized orally with Ad7F, Ad4F, and Ad5F. A low-level antibody response to RSV was induced after the primary immunization, but no significant increases were observed after booster immunizations.",1992
s20625,transfection and expression of a gene coding for a human melanoma antigen recognized by autologous cytolytic t lymphocytes.,"transfection and expression of a gene coding for a human melanoma antigen recognized by autologous cytolytic t lymphocytes.. Human melanoma line MZ2-MEL expresses several antigens recognized by autologous cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL). As a first step towards the cloning of the gene coding for one of these antigens, we tried to obtain transfectants expressing the antigen. The DNA recipient cell was a variant of MZ2-MEL which had been selected with a CTL clone for the loss of antigen E. It was cotransfected with genomic DNA of the original melanoma line and with selective plasmid pSVtkneo beta. Geneticin-resistant transfectants were obtained at a frequency of 2 x 10(-4). These transfectants were then screened for their ability to stimulate the production of tumor necrosis factor by the anti-E CTL clone. One transfectant expressing antigen E was identified among 70,000 drug-resistant transfectants. Its sensitivity to lysis by the anti-E CTL was equal to that of the original melanoma cell line. When this transfectant was submitted to immunoselection with the anti-E CTL clone, the resulting antigen-loss variants were found to have lost several of the transfected pSVtkneo beta sequences. This indicated that the gene coding for the antigen had been integrated in the vicinity of pSVtkneo beta sequences, as expected for cotransfected DNA.",1992
s20700,presentation of viral antigen by mhc class i molecules is dependent on a putative peptide transporter heterodimer.,"presentation of viral antigen by mhc class i molecules is dependent on a putative peptide transporter heterodimer.. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules present peptides derived from the endogenous protein pool to cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which can thus recognize intracellular antigen. This pathway may depend on a transporter (PSF1) to mediate entry of the cytosolic peptides into a pre-Golgi compartment where they bind to class I heavy chains and promote their stable assembly with beta 2-microglobulin. There is, however, only indirect support for this function of PSF1. Here we show that PSF1 is necessary for the efficient assembly of class I molecules and enables them to present a peptide epitope derived from endogenously synthesized viral antigen. Immunochemical and genetic data demonstrate that the PSF1 polypeptide is associated with a complementary transporter chain, which is polymorphic and is encoded by the PSF2 gene, which is closely linked to PSF1.",1992
s21141,human immunodeficiency virus type 1 major neutralizing determinant exposed on hepatitis b surface antigen particles is highly immunogenic in primates.,"human immunodeficiency virus type 1 major neutralizing determinant exposed on hepatitis b surface antigen particles is highly immunogenic in primates.. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) produced by recombinant DNA technology is now widely and safely used worldwide for hepatitis B vaccination. We used the HBsAg particle as a carrier molecule for presentation of selected human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) determinants to the immune system. Immunization of rhesus monkeys with an HBsAg chimera carrying the HIV-1 envelope major neutralizing determinant allowed us to generate proliferative T-cell responses and, in some cases, neutralizing antibodies and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Since there is an overlap between populations at risk for hepatitis B virus and HIV, HBsAg recombinant particles may be relevant carriers for HIV-1 epitopes and could offer a new approach to the development of an AIDS vaccine.",1992

We tested the ability of macaques vaccinated with inactivated whole simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) to resist challenge with either homologous or heterologous cell-free uncloned SIV administered by the intravenous route. The vaccine virus was derived from a proviral DNA clone and thus was considered genetically homogeneous. Sixteen macaques received either hepatitis B surface antigen (n = 6) or the inactivated whole-SIV vaccine (n = 10) at weeks 0, 4, and 49 of the study. All SIV vaccine recipients developed high levels of homologous and heterologous neutralizing antibodies in response to vaccination. At the time of challenge (week 53), vaccinees were further stratified to receive either homologous (n = 10) or heterologous (n = 6) uncloned live SIV. The envelope glycoproteins of the homologous and heterologous challenge viruses were 94% and 81% identical to the vaccine virus, respectively. Regardless of challenge inoculum, all vaccinees in the control group (hepatitis B surface antigen) became infected, whereas all SIV vaccinees were protected against detectable infection. These data support the concept that an efficacious vaccine for HIV might be possible, and suggest that genetic variation of HIV might not be an insurmountable obstacle for vaccine development.",1992

A new recombinant rabies vaccine (human adenovirus 5 containing the rabies glycoprotein gene) was given to striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes). Groups of skunks received the vaccine in baits, by direct instillation into the mouth, or intramuscularly. Foxes were given vaccine by direct instillation into the oral cavity (DIOC). Selected groups of vaccinated skunks and foxes were challenged with street rabies virus. There were high rates of seroconversion (generally with high antibody titers) in both foxes and skunks, with survival of all challenged vaccinated animals (all challenge controls developed rabies). In skunks, vaccine given DIOC was effective over a broad range of doses (10(8.7), 10(7.6) and 10(6.4) median tissue culture infective doses). There was no evidence of pathogenic effects. The results indicate that this adenovirus recombinant has considerable potential as a wildlife oral rabies vaccine.",1992
s21479,hla-a2 molecules in an antigen-processing mutant cell contain signal sequence-derived peptides.,"hla-a2 molecules in an antigen-processing mutant cell contain signal sequence-derived peptides.. The mutant human cell line T2 is defective in antigen presentation in the context of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, and also in that transfected T2 cells show poor surface expression of exogenous human class I (HLA) alleles. Both defects are thought to lie in the transport of antigenic peptides derived from cytosolic proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as peptide-deficient class I molecules might be expected to be either unstable or retained in the ER. The products of several mouse class I (H-2) genes, and the endogenous gene HLA-A2 do, however, reach the surface of T2 cells at reasonable levels although they are non-functional. We report here that, as expected, poorly surface-expressed HLA molecules do not significantly bind endogenous peptides. Surprisingly, H-2 molecules expressed in T2 also lack associated peptides, arguing that 'empty' complexes of mouse class I glycoproteins with human beta 2-microglobulin are neither retained in the ER nor unstable. HLA-A2 molecules, however, do bind high levels of a limited set of endogenous peptides. We have sequenced three of these peptides and find that two, a 9-mer and an 11-mer, are derived from a putative signal sequence (of IP-30, an interferon-gamma-inducible protein), whereas a third, a 13-mer, is of unknown origin. The unusual length of two of the peptides argues that the 9-mers normally associated with HLA-A2 molecules may be generated before their transport from the cytosol rather than in a pre-Golgi compartment. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the isolation of a fragment of a eukaryotic signal peptide generated in vivo.",1992
s21518,auxotrophic live oral shigella flexneri vaccine protects monkeys against challenge with s. flexneri of different serotypes.,"auxotrophic live oral shigella flexneri vaccine protects monkeys against challenge with s. flexneri of different serotypes.. The aromatic-dependent live Shigella flexneri Y strain SFL114, attenuated by a Tn10-inactivated aroD gene, was given as an oral vaccine to 14 Macaca fascicularis monkeys. A significant clinical attenuation of SFL114 was seen (p = 0.0058) as all vaccinated monkeys tolerated 2 x 10(10)-1 x 10(11) bacteria of SFL114, whereas four out of seven monkeys orally given 1 x 10(11) of the virulent parent strain SFL1 developed shigellosis. The average excretion time for SFL114 and SFL1 were 2 and 18 days, respectively. As seen endoscopically SFL1 caused colonic lesions, whereas SFL114 did not. Histopathologic examination of colonic biopsies showed that SFL114 induced only slight acute inflammation, whereas SFL1 caused severe acute inflammation (p less than 0.01). The vaccine strain SFL114 elicited significant species-specific serum immune responses (p less than 0.005) as seen in enzyme immune assays using lipopolysaccharides from S. flexneri serotypes Y, 1b, and 2a and Escherichia coli K-12 as antigens. The titres were comparable to those seen in monkeys given virulent S. flexneri strains. Western blot analyses showed that many prevaccination sera contained antibodies directed against the invasion plasmid-coded polypeptides. However, after vaccination with SFL114 increased amounts of such anti-polypeptide antibodies were seen, particularly in sera from monkeys having a low prevaccination antibody level. SFL114 also elicited a significant species-specific (p less than 0.025) local intestinal sIgA response against the homologous lipopolysaccharide antigen. Vaccinated monkeys were clinically protected against an oral challenge with 1-2 x 10(11) live, virulent S. flexneri strains of any of serotypes Y (strain SFL1), 1b (strain SFL27), or 2a (strain M4243).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1992
s21712,delivery and expression of a heterologous antigen on the surface of streptococci.,"delivery and expression of a heterologous antigen on the surface of streptococci.. We have developed a system in which a foreign antigen replaces nearly all of the surface-exposed region of the fibrillar M protein from Streptococcus pyogenes and is fused to the C-terminal attachment motif of the M molecule. The fusion protein is thus expressed on the surface of Streptococcus gordonii, a commensal organism of the oral cavity. The antigen chosen to be expressed within the context of the M6 molecule was the E7 protein (98 amino acids) of human papillomavirus type 16. Stable recombinant streptococci were obtained by integrating genetic constructs into the chromosome, exploiting in vivo homologous recombination. The M6-E7 fusion protein expressed on the S. gordonii surface was shown to be immunogenic in mice. This is the first step in the construction of recombinant live vaccines in which nonpathogenic streptococci as well as other gram-positive bacteria may be used as vectors to deliver heterologous antigens to the immune system.",1992
s21984,allelic variants of the human putative peptide transporter involved in antigen processing.,"allelic variants of the human putative peptide transporter involved in antigen processing.. Antigen processing for presentation of peptide epitopes by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules involves genes in the MHC class II region. Among these, PSF1 and PSF2 encode subunits of a transporter, which presumably delivers cytosolic peptides across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane to class I molecules. This close functional relationship of the transporter and class I heavy chain genes and their linkage within the MHC raise the question of whether PSF1 and PSF2, like most class I genes, are polymorphic. By single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing, a small number of amino acid sequence variants of both PSF1 and PSF2 was identified in a panel of cell lines. This limited polymorphism may contribute to a higher degree of variability at the level of the functional transporter, in which different alleles of the PSF1 and PSF2 subunits may be combined. A possible involvement of the PSF1 and PSF2 genes in susceptibility to MHC-associated diseases was examined in a preliminary assessment in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, or celiac disease.",1992
s22017,hiv with multiple gene deletions as a live attenuated vaccine for aids.,"hiv with multiple gene deletions as a live attenuated vaccine for aids.. Most viral vaccines currently in use in humans are live attenuated strains of virus that lack pathogenic potential. In general, such live attenuated vaccines induce the strongest longest-lasting immunity. Live attenuated strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) have not been previously considered as vaccines for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) because of an inability to envision how their safety could be adequately assured. This report describes a means for making live, nonpathogenic strains of SIVmac and HIV-1 that cannot revert to a virulent form and a stepwise scheme for demonstrating their safety. Replication-competent, multiply deleted derivatives that are currently being tested are missing combinations of auxiliary genes (nef, vpr, vif, vpx, vpu) and certain control elements in the negative regulatory element (NRE) of the long terminal repeat (LTR). Since these genomic regions are in large part conserved among the SIVs and HIVs, they are likely to be important for the virus life cycle in vivo. Consistent with this line of reasoning, a replication-competent nef deletion mutant of SIVmac apparently has lost most or all of its pathogenic potential, yet it still induces strong immune responses. Multiply deleted derivatives of SIVmac and HIV-1 will have to be extensively tested in animal models prior to moving a promising HIV-1 candidate to initial trials in high-risk human volunteers. Definitive evidence for safety and general acceptance for this approach can only evolve gradually over a prolonged period of time.",1992
s22495,studies on the stability of a human adenovirus-rabies recombinant vaccine.,"studies on the stability of a human adenovirus-rabies recombinant vaccine.. Human adenovirus type 5 containing the rabies virus glycoprotein gene (rHAd-RG1) has potential for the oral vaccination of animals. The stability of this recombinant was tested indoors and outdoors by measuring the loss in virus infectivity. Under indoor conditions the stability of the recombinant virus was studied in an egg yolk-containing commercial stabilizer and a simple buffered salt solution (EBSS; Earle's balanced salt solution) at 4 degrees C and room temperature (24-25 degrees C). Over 16 days, there was a more rapid loss in virus titer at room temperature than at 4 degrees C in both suspending media; however, these differences were slight and may be significant when the overall stability of the vaccine is considered. When the virus was mixed with either 10% (w/v) fox or skunk feces or EBSS, placed on stainless steel disks and the disks kept under ambient conditions (air temperature 24-25 degrees C; relative humidity 45-50%), there was a more rapid decline in virus titer in the fecal suspensions (3% remained after 72 h) than in EBSS (26% remained after 72 h). When bait-coated blister packs of the vaccine were placed in an outdoor location in the fall (October) season, there was a larger drop in the virus titer for vaccines placed in the sun (54% over 32 days) than for those in the shade (40% over 32 days). Incorporating proteinaceous stabilizers in the vaccine samples for outdoor study showed virus stability was not enhanced in their presence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1992

A live, oral Shigella vaccine, constructed by transfer of the 140-MDa invasiveness plasmid from Shigella flexneri 5 and the chromosomal genes encoding the group- and type-specific O antigen of S. flexneri 2a to Escherichia coli K-12, was tested in humans. Designated EcSf2a-1, this vaccine produced adverse reactions (fever, diarrhea, or dysentery) in 4 (31%) of 13 subjects who ingested a single dose of 1.0 x 10(9) CFU, while at better-tolerated doses (5.0 x 10(6) to 5.0 x 10(7) CFU), it provided no significant protection against challenge with S. flexneri 2a. A further-attenuated aroD mutant derivative, EcSf2a-2, was then tested. Rhesus monkeys that received EcSf2a-2 in three oral doses of ca. 1.5 x 10(11) CFU experienced no increase in gastrointestinal symptoms compared with a control group that received an E. coli K-12 placebo. Compared with controls, the vaccinated monkeys were protected against shigellosis after challenge with S. flexneri 2a (60% efficacy; P = 0.001). In humans, EcSf2a-2 was well tolerated at inocula ranging from 5.0 x 10(6) to 2.1 x 10(9) CFU. However, after a single dose of 2.5 x 10(9) CFU, 4 (17%) of 23 subjects experienced adverse reactions, including fever (3 subjects) and diarrhea (209 ml) (1 subject), and after a single dose of 1.8 x 10(10) CFU, 2 of 4 subjects developed dysentery. Recipients of three doses of 1.2 to 2.5 x 10(9) CFU had significant rises in serum antibody to lipopolysaccharide (61%) and invasiveness plasmid antigens (44%) and in gut-derived immunoglobulin A antibody-secreting cells specific for lipopolysaccharide (100%) and invasiveness plasmid antigens (60%). Despite its immunogenicity, the vaccine conferred only 36% protection against illness (fever, diarrhea, or dysentery) induced by experimental challenge (P = 0.17). These findings illustrate the use of an epithelial cell-invasive E. coli strain as a carrier for Shigella antigens. Future studies must explore dosing regimens that might optimize the protective effects of the vaccine while eliminating adverse clinical reactions.",1992
s22542,"structure and function of a 40,000-molecular-weight protein antigen of mycobacterium tuberculosis.","structure and function of a 40,000-molecular-weight protein antigen of mycobacterium tuberculosis.. A gene encoding a protein antigen from Mycobacterium tuberculosis with a molecular weight of 40,000 has been sequenced. On the basis of sequence homology and functional analyses, we demonstrated that the protein is an L-alanine dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.1). The enzyme was demonstrated in M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium marinum but not in Mycobacterium bovis BCG. The enzyme may play a role in cell wall synthesis because L-alanine is an important constituent of the peptidoglycan layer. Although no consensus signal sequence was identified, we found evidence which suggests that the enzyme is secreted across the cell membrane. The enzyme was characterized and purified by chromatography, thus enabling further studies of its role in virulence and interaction with the immune system of M. tuberculosis-infected individuals.",1992
s22571,processing of exogenous liposome-encapsulated antigens in vivo generates class i mhc-restricted t cell responses.,"processing of exogenous liposome-encapsulated antigens in vivo generates class i mhc-restricted t cell responses.. Acid-sensitive liposomes have been developed for cytosolic delivery of encapsulated substances. We now demonstrate delivery of liposome-encapsulated Ag into the class I MHC Ag processing pathway in peritoneal macrophages in vitro using several types of acid-sensitive liposomes, including those composed of dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE)/palmitoylhomocysteine, DOPE/cholesterol hemisuccinate, DOPE/dioleoylsuccinylglycerol, and DOPE/dipalmitoylsuccinylglycerol. Our previous studies showed that acid-resistant liposomes (dioleoylphosphatidylcholine/dioleoylphosphatidylserine) did not engender class I-mediated presentation in vitro. However, in vivo immunization with OVA encapsulated in acid-resistant as well as acid-sensitive liposomes generated class I MHC-restricted T cell responses, as determined by subsequent in vitro cytotoxicity assays using OVA-transfected target cells. Target lysis by these cells was OVA- and class I MHC (Kb)-specific. This response was not generated by immunization with equivalent amounts of soluble OVA. Thus, a pathway for in vivo class I processing of Ag encapsulated in acid-resistant liposomes has been missed in vitro, perhaps because it is dependent on specific populations of APC or interactions between cells that have not been reconstituted in vitro. This pathway may explain the ability of many exogenous particulate Ag (liposomes, bacteria, parasites, and mammalian cells) to generate class I MHC-restricted T cell responses.",1992

An attenuated Salmonella typhi strain has been sought as an improved oral typhoid vaccine and as a carrier of protective antigens of other pathogens to make hybrid vaccines. Ideally, such a strain would be safe and induce protective immune responses after a single oral dose. CVD 908 is a mutant of S. typhi wild-type strain Ty2 with recombinant deletions in two genes, aroC and aroD. In phase 1 testing to date, this strain has not produced febrile responses or other significant adverse reactions in adult volunteers given doses of 5 x 10(4) to 5 x 10(7) organisms with sodium bicarbonate. In addition, after just a single oral dose of 5 x 10(7) colony-forming units, this strain induced IgG seroconversion to S. typhi lipopolysaccharide in 83% of vaccinees and stimulated specific IgA-secreting gut-derived lymphocytes in 100% of vaccinees. CVD 908 is a new oral typhoid vaccine that should be further investigated as a carrier for expressing foreign antigens in recombinant vaccine constructs.",1992
s23353,rapid switching to multiple antigenic and adhesive phenotypes in malaria.,"rapid switching to multiple antigenic and adhesive phenotypes in malaria.. Adhesion of parasitized erythrocytes to post-capillary venular endothelium or uninfected red cells is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Neoantigens at the infected red-cell surface adhere to a variety of host receptors, demonstrate serological diversity in field isolates and may also be a target of the host-protective immune response. Here we use sequential cloning of P. falciparum by micromanipulation to investigate the ability of a parasite to switch antigenic and cytoadherence phenotypes. Our data show that antigens at the parasitized cell surface undergo clonal variation in vitro in the absence of immune pressure at the rate of 2% per generation with concomitant modulations of the adhesive phenotype. A clone has the potential to switch at high frequency to a variety of antigenic and adhesive phenotypes, including a new type of cytoadherence behaviour, 'auto-agglutination' of infected erythrocytes. This rapid appearance of antigenic and functional heterogeneity has important implications for pathogenesis and acquired immunity.",1992
s23385,"recombinant vaccine vector-induced protection of athymic, nude mice from influenza a virus infection. analysis of protective mechanisms.","recombinant vaccine vector-induced protection of athymic, nude mice from influenza a virus infection. analysis of protective mechanisms.. Athymic, nude mice, which normally succumb to virus infection, can resolve infection with recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) engineered to express IL-2. We have demonstrated that interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) produced by natural killer (NK) cells and other immunocytes in response to the virus-encoded interleukin-2 (IL-2) is crucial to recovery. Here, we extend this work to show that nude mice, when primed intravenously with rVV co-expressing both IL-2 and an influenza virus haemagglutinin (HA) gene, are also protected following challenge with a lethal dose of homologous influenza virus. A substantial increase in the number of influenza virus-reactive antibody-secreting cells producing antibody of the IgM isotype, but not of the IgG or IgA isotypes, was found in spleens and lungs of the protected mice. Treatment with monoclonal antibodies to IFN-gamma or to the NK marker, as GM1, at challenge and thereafter, led to their death however, though the specific IgM antibody response was unaffected. These data suggest that both specific antibody and non-specific antiviral reactivity are important elements of the protective response and show that this immunization strategy may be used to protect severely immunocompromised individuals.",1992
s23556,antitumor activity and immune responses induced by a recombinant carcinoembryonic antigen-vaccinia virus vaccine.,"antitumor activity and immune responses induced by a recombinant carcinoembryonic antigen-vaccinia virus vaccine.. BACKGROUND: Human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a 180-kd glycoprotein expressed in human colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, breast, and non-small-cell lung carcinomas. Previous studies have demonstrated enhanced immune responses to other antigens presented with vaccinia virus proteins via a recombinant vaccinia virus construct. In addition, we have developed a recombinant CEA-vaccinia virus construct, designated rV(WR)-CEA, and have demonstrated humoral anti-CEA responses in mice after immunization with that virus. PURPOSE: The goals of this study were (a) to construct a recombinant CEA-vaccinia vaccine in a less virulent vaccinia strain that is potentially safe and effective for treatment of patients whose tumors express CEA and (b) to evaluate the ability of the recombinant CEA-vaccinia vaccine to prevent and reverse tumor growth in mice and to elicit cell-mediated and humoral anti-CEA immune responses. METHODS: Using the New York City strain of vaccinia virus, which is used in smallpox vaccination and is more attenuated for humans than rV(WR), we derived a recombinant CEA-vaccinia construct, designated rV(NYC)-CEA. The ability of this construct to induce antitumor immunity was evaluated in mice receiving subcutaneous injections of murine colon adenocarcinoma cells expressing the human CEA gene. RESULTS: Administration of rV(NYC)-CEA in mice induced strong anti-CEA antibody responses, as well as CEA-specific cell-mediated responses, including delayed-type hypersensitivity, lymphoproliferative, and cytotoxic responses. Vaccination of mice with the rV(NYC)-CEA rendered them resistant to the growth of subsequently transplanted CEA-expressing tumors. Moreover, when mice were vaccinated 7 days after tumor cell injection, tumor growth was either greatly reduced or eliminated. No toxic effects were observed in any of the mice. CONCLUSION: These studies demonstrate that antitumor activity can be induced with the use of a recombinant CEA-vaccinia virus construct derived from an attenuated vaccinia strain, and they reveal the range of cell-mediated and humoral responses induced by this recombinant vaccine.",1992
s23754,ubiquitous nuclear factors bind specifically to a 5'-region conserved in carcinoembryonic antigen-related genes.,"ubiquitous nuclear factors bind specifically to a 5'-region conserved in carcinoembryonic antigen-related genes.. We recently cloned members of the murine carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene family, some of which are differentially expressed during placental development. By intra- and interspecies sequence comparisons, we identified an element in the putative promoter and/or 5'-nontranslated region which is conserved within all human and rodent CEA-related genes analyzed so far. Using gel retardation analysis and DNaseI hypersensitive site mapping, we now show that ubiquitously expressed nuclear factors specifically bind to the conserved region derived from the mouse gene Cea-2 in vitro and probably also in vivo. Another DNaseI hypersensitive site lies within or close to a simple sequence motif [(GGA)n] located in the first intron of Cea-2. Such sequences have been reported to play a role in the regulation of certain genes. Therefore, this analysis has identified putative regulatory regions for Cea-2 and possibly CEA-related genes in general.",1992
s23979,developmental expression of surface antigen genes in the parasitic ciliate ichthyophthirius multifiliis.,"developmental expression of surface antigen genes in the parasitic ciliate ichthyophthirius multifiliis.. A 1.2-kilobase (kb) cDNA encoding a major surface antigen of the holotrich ciliate Ichthyophthirius multifiliis (an obligate parasite of fish) has been isolated and used as a probe to examine the expression of immobilization antigen (i-antigen) genes in this system. The cDNA encodes a predicted protein of 394 amino acids with a tandemly repeated structure characteristic of the i-antigens of the related free-living ciliates Paramecium and Tetrahymena. As shown by Northern hybridization analysis with both total and poly(A)+ RNAs, the 1.2-kb cDNA recognizes distinct transcripts of 1.6 and 1.9 kb which are differentially expressed through the parasite life cycle. During the transition from the host-associated trophozoite stage to the infective tomite stage, steady-state levels of the 1.9-kb RNA undergo a marked increase of greater than or equal to 50-fold, while the 1.6-kb transcript increases only slightly. The absolute amounts of RNA encoding the i-antigen have been quantitated and were found to reach extremely high levels equivalent to approximately 6% of the poly(A)+ RNA of I. multifiliis tomites. Southern hybridization analysis with I. multifiliis genomic DNA suggests that at least two genes encode the i-antigen transcripts. In experiments to examine the effects of temperature on the expression of I. multifiliis i-antigen genes, levels of the 1.6- and 1.9-kb transcripts were found to remain relatively constant in cells maintained at different temperature extremes. These studies indicate that genes encoding i-antigens of I. multifiliis are developmentally regulated, and they suggest the existence of alternative mechanisms for the control of surface antigen expression in ciliates.",1992
s24166,characterization of murine carcinoembryonic antigen gene family members.,"characterization of murine carcinoembryonic antigen gene family members.. The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a human tumor marker whose gene belongs to a family with more than 20 members. This gene family codes for a group of proteins with in vitro cell adhesion properties and for a group of abundantly expressed pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSG) with unknown functions. As a basis for in vivo functional studies, we have started to analyze the murine CEA gene family and have identified five new members (Cea-2 to Cea-6). cDNA clones were isolated for Cea-2, Cea-3, and Cea-6. The deduced amino acid sequences of Cea-2 and Cea-6 indicate three IgV-like (N), followed by one IgC-like (A) domain (N1-N2-N3-A). We have also partially characterized the Cea-2 gene and two additional ones, Cea-4 and Cea-5. Cea-2 and Cea-4 are separated by only 16 kb, suggesting a close linkage of murine CEA-related genes, as found for the human CEA gene family. Cea-5 was located to the proximal region of mouse Chromosome (Chr) 7, which is syntenic to part of human Chr 19, containing the human CEA gene family cluster. Cea-2, Cea-3, and a Cea-4-like gene are differentially transcribed in the placenta during pregnancy, but not in other organs tested. This expression pattern strongly suggests that they represent counterparts of the human PSG subgroup members, despite the presence of multiple IgV-like domains, a feature not found for human PSGs. The more distantly related Cea-5 seems to be ubiquitously expressed. The putative promoter region of Cea-2 lacks typical TATA- or CAAT-boxes, but contains other conserved motifs that could play a role in the initiation of transcription.",1992
s24242,construction of a multivalent meningococcal vaccine strain based on the class 1 outer membrane protein.,"construction of a multivalent meningococcal vaccine strain based on the class 1 outer membrane protein.. Outer membrane complexes (OMCs) are promising vaccine candidates for protection against meningococcal disease. However, a major obstacle to this approach is the fact that the protective antibodies induced are generally type specific. In an attempt to overcome this problem, we have investigated the possibility of constructing a multivalent vaccine strain by insertion of an additional class 1 outer membrane protein-encoding gene. Starting with a derivative of strain H44/76 deficient in class 3 outer membrane protein, a second class 1 gene was inserted into the chromosome, through homologous recombination with a suicide plasmid carrying the class 1 gene from strain 2996 placed within a class 5 gene. In this way, a strain was obtained in which a class 3 protein was in effect replaced by a class 1 protein from another subtype, i.e. P1.5,2 in addition to the P1.7,16 protein of H44/76. Immunization of mice with such OMCs resulted in high bactericidal titers against both H44/76 and 2996, where normally only strain-specific antibodies are induced. Mutational removal of class 3 protein from the immunizing OMCs had no detectable effect on the bactericidal titer against H44/76, whereas removal of class 1 protein led to a strong reduction. These results demonstrate the dominant role of the subtype-specific sequences of class 1 protein in the induction of bactericidal antibodies and show that construction of a multivalent OMC-based vaccine should be feasible.",1992
s24244,"mxia of shigella flexneri 2a, which facilitates export of invasion plasmid antigens, encodes a homolog of the low-calcium-response protein, lcrd, of yersinia pestis.","mxia of shigella flexneri 2a, which facilitates export of invasion plasmid antigens, encodes a homolog of the low-calcium-response protein, lcrd, of yersinia pestis.. The plasmid-encoded invasion plasmid antigen (Ipa) export accessory locus of Shigella flexneri 2a, mxiA, was cloned, and the complete DNA sequence of the gene was determined. The mixA open reading frame was found to encode a polypeptide of 74.03 kDa with a pI of 5.02. A hydropathy analysis of the predicted protein revealed a hydrophilic C terminus and an extremely hydrophobic N terminus without a cleavable signal sequence but with several potential membrane-spanning regions. While a homology search did not reveal any significant relatedness of the mxiA DNA sequence to any known bacterial gene sequences, the derived amino acid sequence of MxiA was found to be highly homologous (68%) to the sequence of the protein encoded by the low-calcium-response locus, lcrD, of Yersinia pestis. The lcrD encodes an inner membrane regulatory protein that has an N-terminal membrane anchor and that is implicated in facilitating the export of Y. pestis outer membrane proteins (G. V. Plano, S. S. Barve, and S. C. Straley, J. Bacteriol. 173:7293-7303, 1991). Congo red binding, HeLa cell invasion, and Ipa excretion were restored in two avirulent mxiA fusion mutants when they were transformed with a cloned copy of the mxiA gene. Furthermore, the expression of the cloned mxiA gene was independent of any vector-specified promoter, suggesting that the transcription of mxiA is driven by its own promoter in this clone. In contrast, the overexpression of mxiA that resulted when it was placed under the control of the lac promoter was found to be deleterious in Escherichia coli. We conclude that mxiA is a homolog of the Y. pestis lcrD locus and may function similarly in S. flexneri, either by directly affecting the excretion of virulence factors or by regulating the expression of export accessory genes.",1992

We report the cloning of the genomic variable region genes of the human carcinoma reactive murine monoclonal antibody L6 and their genetic linkage to human constant region exons to encode a human IgG1/kappa chimeric antibody. The chimeric protein was produced at levels greater than 20 micrograms/ml (enabling the initiation of clinical trials) and was found to have binding properties identical with that of the murine parent. The nucleic acid sequence of the variable regions was determined and found to be different than that previously reported (1). The deduced amino acid sequence was then used to generate a structural homology based three-dimensional model of the antibody binding site, which was found to share features with antibodies known to interact with a protein surface, but distinct from those that bind to carbohydrate epitopes. Biochemical analysis of binding between antibody and the in vitro-translated product of a cDNA clone that confers L6 immunoreactivity demonstrates that the antibody recognizes a protein epitope encoded by this transcript which requires the presence of membranes, but is unaffected by the removal of carbohydrate side chains.",1992
s24467,evaluation in volunteers of a candidate live oral attenuated salmonella typhi vector vaccine.,"evaluation in volunteers of a candidate live oral attenuated salmonella typhi vector vaccine.. Candidate vector vaccine strain CVD 906 (aroC- and aroD- derivative of virulent Salmonella typhi strain ISP1820) was evaluated in phase 1 clinical trials. The first nine volunteers ingested a single dose of 5 x 10(7) CVD 906 bacilli. At this dose CVD 906 stimulates remarkable systemic and mucosal immune responses, inasmuch as 89% of volunteers developed marked serum antibody levels to S. typhi antigens and high numbers of antigen-specific gut-derived antibody-secreting cells. Four (44%) volunteers developed asymptomatic vaccinemia 4-10 d after immunization and all volunteers excreted CVD 906 on at least one occasion. However, two volunteers developed febrile adverse reactions, one on the day of vaccination and the other on day 4. Of 11 volunteers who ingested a single dose of 5 x 10(3) CVD 906 bacilli, none displayed side effects but 27% developed significant serum responses to S. typhi LPS. In vitro, CVD 906 replicates for only nine generations in pooled human serum, indicating that CVD 906 growth is limited in this physiologically relevant medium. In phorbol myristate acetate-induced U937 human macrophage-like cells, CVD 906 replicates intracellularly to a lesser extent than parent strain ISP1820. Although, strain CVD 906 is attenuated and highly immunogenic, the occasional febrile reactions at high doses indicate that further attenuation of this strain is necessary.",1992

The HBs gene encoding 25 amino acids of preS2 and the whole of the S region was inserted into the TK gene of the cloned plasmid. The chimeric plasmid DNA and Oka varicella vaccine DNA were cotransfected and recombinant virus was isolated after immunofluorescence screening using a monoclonal antibody to HBs and a fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Expression of viral HBs was detected in the cytoplasm of infected cells and was stable over several repeated passages in vitro. The recombinant virus expressed 26K and 30K HBs molecules in infected cells and the culture supernatant contained 30K and 35K HBs molecules. HBs was purified at a density of 1.20 g/ml from the culture supernatants. The recombinant virus induced an antibody response to HBs as well as to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in guinea-pigs, and the antibody titre to HBs was comparable to that induced by a recombinant HBs subunit vaccine produced in yeast. Thus a single dose of live recombinant Oka varicella vaccine could induce good immunity to VZV and HBs. The recombinant Oka varicella vaccine expressing HBs may be a good candidate for a combined HBV and VZV vaccine.",1991
s24640,developments in foot-and-mouth disease vaccines.,"developments in foot-and-mouth disease vaccines.. The current status of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) vaccine production is reviewed. The production of antigen in bovine tongue epithelium (Frenkel culture) is described and improvements in monolayer and suspension cultures of cell lines are outlined. Inactivation of viral antigen and safety tests are discussed. A 'minimum safety level' is recommended: at the end of the inactivation process, antigen batches of any size should contain less than one virus particle. After inactivation the antigen can be formulated into a vaccine or purified and concentrated for storage at ultra-low temperatures in a vaccine bank. Vaccines prepared with the adjuvants Al(OH)3 and saponin are compared with (double) oil emulsion vaccines. Because oil vaccines can protect both cattle and pigs and induce long-term protection, they are most suitable for use in ring vaccinations. A new generation of vaccines, based on constructed modified-live viruses or (bio-) synthetic peptides, is briefly reviewed.",1991
s24894,the carboxyl-terminal end of protective antigen is required for receptor binding and anthrax toxin activity.,"the carboxyl-terminal end of protective antigen is required for receptor binding and anthrax toxin activity.. Anthrax toxin consists of three separate proteins produced by Bacillus anthracis: protective antigen (PA), lethal factor (LF), and edema factor (EF). Previous work showed that the process by which these proteins damage eukaryotic cells begins with binding of PA (83 kDa) to cell surface receptors. PA is then cleaved by a cell surface protease so as to expose a high-affinity binding site for LF or EF on the COOH-terminal, receptor-bound, 63-kilodalton fragment. In this report we more closely define a region of PA involved in receptor binding. The gene encoding PA was mutagenized so as to delete 3, 5, 7, 12, or 14 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of the protein, and the truncated PA variants were purified from Bacillus subtilis or Escherichia coli. Deletion of 3, 5, or 7 amino acids reduced the binding of PA to cells and the subsequent toxicity of the PA.LF complex to J774A.1 cells and also the ability to cause EF binding to cells. Deletion of 12 or 14 amino acids completely eliminated all these activities. These results show that the carboxy terminus comprises or is part of the receptor-binding domain of PA.",1991
s24956,preferential expression of the large hepatitis b virus surface antigen gene by an adenovirus-hepatitis b virus recombinant.,"preferential expression of the large hepatitis b virus surface antigen gene by an adenovirus-hepatitis b virus recombinant.. Using an adenovirus-hepatitis B virus (HBV) recombinant, expression of the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) genes was examined in various cell lines using S1 nuclease mapping and radioimmunoassay. The steady-state level of the 2.4 kb RNA encoding the large HBsAg was much greater than, or the same as, that of the 2.0 kb RNA, encoding the middle and major HBsAgs, in primate cells, but was negligible in non-primate cells, as is the case in most expression systems. According to the amount of 2.4 kb RNA expressed, cells were classified into three groups: those in which (1) the amount of 2.4 kb RNA was much greater than that of 2.0 kb RNA (HepG2 and JHH-4), (2) the amount of 2.4 kb RNA was the same as that of 2.0 kb (Hul-1, HeLa and other non-hepatic primate cells), and (3) the amount of 2.4 kb RNA was less than one-tenth of that of 2.0 kb RNA (rodent cells). Radioimmunoassay revealed that most HBsAg is located intracellularly in primate cells, but is secreted into the culture medium of rodent cells. The expression of 2.4 kb RNA was unaffected by an inhibitor of DNA synthesis in HepG2 cells, which are of human liver origin, whereas it was strongly inhibited in human non-hepatic HeLa cells.",1991
s25019,recombination of pseudorabies virus vaccine strains in swine.,"recombination of pseudorabies virus vaccine strains in swine.. We report here genetic recombination between 2 USDA-licensed vaccine strains of pseudorabies virus co-inoculated into swine. The vaccine strains, one of which was a conventionally attenuated strain and the other, a genetically engineered deleted strain containing a negative immunologic marker, had complementary genomes. Co-inoculation resulted in the creation of novel strains of pseudorabies virus containing negative immunologic markers with restored virulence genes. Plaque-purified recombinant progeny viruses were found in 2 litters of pigs in which both strains were co-inoculated IM, a litter in which both strains were co-inoculated oronasally, and a litter in which the conventionally attenuated strain was inoculated oronasally and the genetically engineered strain was inoculated IM. Recombinant phenotypes and recombinant restriction fragment patterns were observed. The creation, spread, and potential misdiagnosis of these types of recombinant strains could disrupt control and eradication programs that are based on the serologic identification of swine infected with potentially virulent strains of pseudorabies virus.",1991
s25160,correlation between invariant chain expression level and capability to present antigen to mhc class ii-restricted t cells.,"correlation between invariant chain expression level and capability to present antigen to mhc class ii-restricted t cells.. In this study we investigated the role of the invariant chain (li) in the presentation of hen egg lysozyme (HEL) and measles virus hemagglutinin (HA) antigens to MHC class II-restricted T hybridoma cells. Fibroblastic cells transfected with Ed or Ak genes, and supertransfected or not with the li gene, were used as antigen-presenting cells (APC). For every APC pair analysed, the amount of exogenous antigen needed to obtain a T-cell response was inversely correlated with the level of li expression. Exogenously provided HEL was efficiently presented by li-supertransfected APC at doses of 10 micrograms/ml or below. In contrast, non-li transfected fibroblastic cells, which express a low level of endogenous li, required at least 10 times more HEL to stimulate most of the T hybridoma cells. Analogous results were also obtained using exogenous HA. Finally, two different experiments suggest that basal li expressed in fibroblastic cells is involved in the presentation of exogenous antigen. In the first one, we showed that li/class II ratio was increased in high-density grown fibroblastic cells and that this increase correlates with the ability of the cells to present exogenous antigen. In the second, treating high-density grown cells with an antisense li oligodeoxynucleotide could impair their ability to present exogenous HEL. We also examined the presentation of endogenously-synthesized HEL or HA after introduction of the antigen into the biosynthetic pathway of the APC by transfection of HEL and HA cDNAs. There was no apparent difference in the capability of high density grown fibroblastic cells, transfected or not with li gene, to present endogenous HEL or HA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1991
s25244,the t cell activation antigen cd27 is a member of the nerve growth factor/tumor necrosis factor receptor gene family.,"the t cell activation antigen cd27 is a member of the nerve growth factor/tumor necrosis factor receptor gene family.. CD27 is a dimeric membrane glycoprotein found on the surface of most human T lymphocytes. Activation of T cells by engagement of the Ag receptor increases CD27 surface expression, and anti-CD27 antibodies augment Ag receptor-mediated T cell proliferation. In this study a cDNA-encoding CD27 was isolated by expression and immunoselection in COS cells. The predicted polypeptide was found to belong to a recently characterized family of cysteine-rich receptors whose known ligands include nerve growth factor and TNF-alpha and -beta. Structural similarities suggest that CD27 belongs to a lymphocyte-specific subgroup of the family, comprised of the B cell Ag CD40, the rat T cell subset Ag OX40, and the mouse T cell activation Ag 4-1BB. Recent studies suggest some of these molecules may play a role in the survival of activated cells.",1991
s25252,structure and genetic variability of envelope glycoproteins of two antigenic variants of caprine arthritis-encephalitis lentivirus.,"structure and genetic variability of envelope glycoproteins of two antigenic variants of caprine arthritis-encephalitis lentivirus.. To define the structure of the caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV) env gene and characterize genetic changes which occur during antigenic variation, we sequenced the env genes of CAEV-63 and CAEV-Co, two antigenic variants of CAEV defined by serum neutralization. The deduced primary translation product of the CAEV env gene consists of a 60- to 80-amino-acid signal peptide followed by an amino-terminal surface protein (SU) and a carboxy-terminal transmembrane protein (TM) separated by an Arg-Lys-Lys-Arg cleavage site. The signal peptide cleavage site was verified by amino-terminal amino acid sequencing of native CAEV-63 SU. In addition, immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled CAEV-63 proteins by sera from goats immunized with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the CAEV-63 env gene confirmed that antibodies induced by env-encoded recombinant proteins react specifically with native virion SU and TM. The env genes of CAEV-63 and CAEV-Co encode 28 conserved cysteines and 25 conserved potential N-linked glycosylation sites. Nucleotide sequence variability results in 62 amino acid changes and one deletion within the SU and 34 amino acid changes within the TM.",1991
s25351,variable region gene analysis of pathologic human autoantibodies to the related i and i red blood cell antigens.,"variable region gene analysis of pathologic human autoantibodies to the related i and i red blood cell antigens.. To investigate the molecular basis of the autoimmune response to the related i and I carbohydrate antigens, we studied cold agglutinins (CA) from B-cell clones and from the peripheral circulation of patients with lymphoproliferative syndromes. Sequence analyses of expressed variable region genes indicate that both anti-i and anti-I specificities from B-cell clones from two patients are encoded by the VH4.21 or a very closely related VH4 heavy chain gene, whereas the expressed light chain genes differed. The anti-i-secreting B-cells express unmutated germline-encoded VH4.21 and VKI gene sequences. The VH region gene encoding anti-I has the closest homology (97%) to the VH4.21 germline gene and differs at the protein level by only three amino acids. In contrast, while the VL region gene encoding anti-I is most homologous (96%) to the VKIII, kv328 germline gene, there are seven amino acid differences due to nonrandom replacement mutations, which suggests a role for antigen-mediated selection in the anti-I response of this individual. These studies were extended by a structural survey of 20 additional serum CA using antipeptide antibodies specific for determinants in VH and VL regions. All anti-I and anti-i CA were shown to express VH4 heavy chains, and 14 of 17 CA expressed a previously described VH4 second hypervariable region determinant, termed VH4-HV2a. We also found that 13 of 14 anti-I CA used VKIII light chains, while the anti-i CA used light chains from at least three VL families. Taken together, the data show that anti-i and anti-I CA probably both derive from the VH4.21 gene (or a closely related gene). Furthermore, the restricted VH and different VL gene use in anti-i and anti-I CA may reflect the close structural relationship of the i and I antigens.",1991
s25432,"structural analysis and transcriptional mapping of the marek's disease virus gene encoding pp38, an antigen associated with transformed cells.","structural analysis and transcriptional mapping of the marek's disease virus gene encoding pp38, an antigen associated with transformed cells.. The gene encoding a Marek's disease virus (MDV) pp38 phosphoprotein has been identified, sequenced, and localized to the BamHI H fragment to the left of the putative MDV origin of replication. The open reading frame was defined by sequencing of a lacZ-pp38 fusion protein gene from a lambda gt11 expression library. The entire open reading frame is 290 amino acids long and codes for a protein with a calculated molecular weight of 31,169, compared with the size of 38 kDa of the phosphorylated form estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. S1 nuclease protection analysis showed that the pp38 gene is transcribed leftward as an unspliced mRNA. On the basis of transcriptional mapping studies, the pp38 transcript is predicted to be about 1.8 kb in length without a poly(A) sequence. Its promoter-enhancer region overlaps that of the major rightward BamHI H 1.8-kb transcript implicated in tumor induction. This region contains Oct-1, Sp1, and CCAAT motifs as well as the putative origin of replication. The pp38 protein is the only presently known antigen that is consistently associated with the transformation state. It may play a significant role in MDV transformation.",1991
s25556,limited t-cell receptor beta-chain heterogeneity among interleukin 2 receptor-positive synovial t cells suggests a role for superantigen in rheumatoid arthritis.,"limited t-cell receptor beta-chain heterogeneity among interleukin 2 receptor-positive synovial t cells suggests a role for superantigen in rheumatoid arthritis.. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a disease affecting the synovial membranes of articulating joints that is thought to result from T-cell-mediated autoimmune phenomena. T cells responsible for the pathogenesis of RA are likely present in that fraction of synovial T cells that expresses the interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R), one marker of T-cell activation. We report herein an analysis of T-cell receptor (TCR) beta-chain gene expression by IL-2R-positive synovial T cells. These T cells were isolated from uncultured synovial tissue specimens by using IL-2R-specific monoclonal antibodies and magnetic beads, and TCR beta-chain transcription was analyzed by PCR-catalyzed amplification using a panel of primers specific for the human TCR beta-chain variable region (V beta). Multiple V beta gene families were found to be transcribed in these patients samples; however, three gene families, V beta 3, V beta 14, and V beta 17, were found in a majority of the five synovial samples analyzed, suggesting that T cells bearing these V beta s had been selectively retained in the synovial microenvironment. In many instances, the V beta 3, V beta 14, or V beta 17 repertoires amplified from an individual patient were dominated by a single rearrangement, indicative of clonal expansion in the synovium and supportive of a role for these T cells in RA. Of note is a high sequence similarity between V beta 3, V beta 14, and V beta 17 polypeptides, particularly in the fourth complementarity-determining region (CDR). Given that binding sites for superantigens have been mapped to the CDR4s of TCR beta chains, the synovial localization of T cells bearing V beta s with significant CDR4 homology indicates that V beta-specific T-cell activation by superantigen may play a role in RA.",1991
s25562,processing and antigenicity of entire and anchor-free spike glycoprotein s of coronavirus tgev expressed by recombinant baculovirus.,"processing and antigenicity of entire and anchor-free spike glycoprotein s of coronavirus tgev expressed by recombinant baculovirus.. The S gene of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was inserted into the genome of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) using the transfer plasmid pVL941. Infection of Sf9 insect cells with the recombinant virus resulted in the synthesis of a 175K polypeptide which was able to trimerize and was transported to the cell surface as is the authentic TGEV S protein. Despite the lack of complete carbohydrate processing, the recombinant S protein exhibited antigenic properties similar to TGEV S and induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies in immunized rats. Engineering a deletion (70 amino acids) into the carboxy-terminus containing the membrane anchor of the polypeptide allowed its secretion. The oligomerization process and the antigenic profile of the anchor-free S protein were shown to be partially altered.",1991

Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a paramyxovirus that bears two envelope glycoproteins at the virion surface. These proteins, fusion and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), are involved in the immune response against NDV infection. Recombinant cells constitutively expressing at their surface the HN protein from the velogenic Texas strain were generated by introducing the HN gene with a helper-free AEV-based vector. These recombinant cells were used to immunize chickens by various protocols, and birds were subsequently challenged with a lethal NDV injection. Both NDV protection and serologic response were observed.",1991
s25700,molecular and antigenic analyses of serotypes 8 and 10 of bovine rotaviruses in thailand.,"molecular and antigenic analyses of serotypes 8 and 10 of bovine rotaviruses in thailand.. Antigenic and genomic properties of non-serotype 6 bovine rotaviruses isolated in Thailand and Japan were studied by cross-neutralization tests, nucleotide sequence determination of the VP7 gene, and RNA-RNA hybridization. Two Thai strains (61A and A44) were serologically related to a Japanese isolate KK3 which has been assigned to serotype 10. In contrast, strain A5 was found to be antigenically similar to human strain 69M with serotype 8 specificity, although strain A5 showed a one-way cross-reaction with serotype 6 strain NCDV. VP7 sequence analysis confirmed these results. High degrees of similarity in nucleotide and amino acid sequences (92.5 to 98.2% and 96.3 to 97.9%, respectively) were found among the VP7 genes of the four serotype 10 bovine strains (61A, A44, KK3 and B223). The VP7 amino acid sequence of strain A5 was similar to those of serotype 8 human strains (91.7% and 94.8% for strains B37 and 69M, respectively). In RNA-RNA hybridization experiments, a high level of overall relatedness was found among the three serotype 10 bovine strains (61A, A44 and KK3), and strains A5 and NCDV were also moderately related to the three serotype 10 viruses. All the bovine rotaviruses tested in this study, regardless of their serotype specificity, exhibited a moderate genetic-relatedness to strain 69M of serotype 8, and, to a lesser extent, to serotype 2 human rotavirus strains.",1991

A genetically engineered subunit vaccine against FeLV infection was developed. The protective immunogen in the vaccine was a purified recombinant protein containing the entire amino acid sequence of FeLV subgroup A gp70 envelope protein. The optimal adjuvant was determined to be a highly purified saponin, QS-21, derived from Quillaja saponaria Molina. A vaccine formulation containing the recombinant protein, QS-21, and aluminum hydroxide was tested in specific-pathogen-free kittens and was shown to induce neutralizing antibodies as well as appreciable antibody responses to native gp70 by enzyme immunoassay and protein (western) immunoblot analysis and of whole virus preparations.",1991
s25982,effect of the sv40 t antigen on the posttranscriptional regulation of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen and dna polymerase-alpha genes.,"effect of the sv40 t antigen on the posttranscriptional regulation of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen and dna polymerase-alpha genes.. tk-ts13 cells are G1-specific temperature-sensitive mutants of the cell cycle that arrest in G1 at the restrictive temperature. In these cells the mRNAs for early growth-regulated genes (for instance, c-myc) are inducible by serum at both permissive and restrictive temperatures. In contrast, the mRNAs for late growth-regulated genes [such as histones, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and DNA polymerase-alpha] are not detectable at the restrictive temperature, although they are normally induced by serum at the permissive temperature. Despite the absence of their mRNAs at the restrictive temperature, transcription rates for DNA polymerase-alpha, PCNA, and histone H3 are the same in serum-deprived cells and in cells that are serum stimulated at either the permissive or the restrictive temperature. Since the half-lives of the mRNAs are not substantially different at the two temperatures, the conclusion is that in tk-ts13 cells the mRNA levels of these late growth-regulated genes are regulated at a posttranscriptional level, presumably during hnRNA processing. When serum-deprived tk-ts13 cells carrying a stably integrated SV40 T antigen-coding gene (T-neo cells) are stimulated with serum, they are capable of one additional round of DNA replication at the restrictive temperature. At 20 h after stimulation of T-neo cells, the mRNAs for the late growth-regulated genes are detectable at the restrictive temperature in amounts not substantially different than those at the permissive temperature. Transcription rates in T-neo cells are increased for histone H3 (in comparison to tk-ts13 cells) but not for PCNA and DNA polymerase-alpha. The presence of the T antigen does not seem to seriously affect the half-lives of the mature mRNAs. The conclusion is that the presence of the SV40 T antigen in tk-ts13 cells promotes the appearance of mature mRNAs for DNA polymerase-alpha and PCNA. These experiments suggest that T antigen, in this instance, may intervene either directly or indirectly at a posttranscriptional level in the regulation of the steady state mRNA levels of certain cellular genes.",1991
s25994,safety of and immunological response to a recombinant vaccinia virus vaccine expressing hiv envelope glycoprotein.,"safety of and immunological response to a recombinant vaccinia virus vaccine expressing hiv envelope glycoprotein.. In a randomised phase I trial of a recombinant vaccina virus vaccine expressing the gp160 envelope gene of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIVAC-1e) 35 healthy, HIV-seronegative males, 31 of whom had a history of smallpox immunisation and 4 of whom were vaccinia naive, were vaccinated and then boosted 8 weeks later with HIVAC-1e or standard NY strain vaccinia virus. The frequency, duration, and titre of virus isolation from the vaccination site and occurrence of local side-effects were similar between the two groups of vaccinees. Vaccinia-naive (vac-n) subjects shed virus from the vaccination site for longer and at a higher titre than did vaccinia-primed (vac-p) individuals (19 vs 7 days and 10(7) vs 10(5) pfu/ml, respectively). In-vitro T-cell proliferative responses to one or more HIV antigen preparations developed in 13 of 16 vaccinia-primed subjects inoculated with HIVAC-1e. T-cell responses were, however, transient and in no subject did antibodies to HIV become detectable. The 2 vaccinia-naive subjects vaccinated with HIVAC-1e showed strong T-cell responses to homologous and heterologous strains of whole virus and to recombinant gp160 protein that remained detectable for over a year; antibodies to HIV envelope also developed in both. Recombinant vaccinia virus vaccines induce T-cell priming to the foreign gene products in most individuals. If used as the sole immunising agent they will be most efficacious in vaccinia-naive individuals.",1991
s26133,cloned alpha and beta c-protein antigens of group b streptococci elicit protective immunity.,"cloned alpha and beta c-protein antigens of group b streptococci elicit protective immunity.. Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococci [GBS]) is the leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in the United States. The surface-associated C proteins of GBS play a role in immunity, but their number, size, structure, function, and virulence properties have not been well characterized. A recombinant library of DNA fragments from GBS strain A909 (type Ia/C) was prepared in the plasmid pUX12, a specially constructed Escherichia coli expression vector. The library was screened with a rabbit antiserum shown to be protective for passive immunity to GBS infection in a mouse lethality model. Clones were divided into two distinct groups on the basis of DNA-DNA cross-hybridization, restriction enzyme analysis, and the expression of antigenic proteins in E. coli. A characteristic clone from each group was chosen for further study. Clone pJMS23 expresses gene products that biochemically and immunologically correspond to the trypsin-resistant, C-protein alpha antigen. Clone pJMS1 expresses a gene product that binds to immunoglobulin A and is similar to the trypsin-sensitive, C-protein beta antigen. Antisera raised in rabbits against E. coli containing each of the plasmid clones were able to elicit protective immunity in mice challenged by GBS strains carrying the C proteins but not by non-C-protein-bearing strains. Southern blot analysis shows no DNA homology between the clones, and there is no immunological cross-reactivity between the antigens they express. Therefore, pJMS23 and pJMS1 encode two different C proteins that define unique protective epitopes.",1991
s26341,characterization of the signaling function of mhc class ii molecules during antigen presentation by b cells.,"characterization of the signaling function of mhc class ii molecules during antigen presentation by b cells.. In addition to their role as peptide binding proteins, MHC class II proteins can also function as signal transducing molecules. Recent work using B cells expressing genetically engineered truncated MHC class II molecules has suggested that signaling through the cytoplasmic domains of these proteins plays an important role in the generation of signals required for the activation of some T cell hybrids. Treatment of truncated Ia-expressing B cells with cAMP-elevating agents corrects the deficiency in Ag presentation by these cells. We report that the MHC class II-mediated signal appears to act by a mechanism that increases the efficiency of Ag presentation by B cells thereby lowering the amount of specific Ag required for T cell activation. We further show that the induction of the cAMP-induced signal in B cells is inhibited by cycloheximide and cytochalasin A, implicating protein synthesis as well as cytoskeletal rearrangements in Ag presentation to accessory signal- dependent hybrids. In contrast, these agents do not block Ag presentation to a T cell hybrid previously shown not to require the cAMP-induced signal for activation. The signal-dependent T hybrid is additionally dependent on LFA-1-ICAM-1 interaction for activation, whereas the signal-independent hybrid is not. These observations suggest the existence of two types of T cell hybrid with respect to their requirements for activation: those that require only the recognition of MHC class II-peptide complexes without accessory signals, as shown by their ability to respond to purified Ia on planar membranes, and those that, in addition to recognition of MHC II/Ag, require LFA-1-ICAM-1 interaction and the delivery of additional signal(s) induced in the B cell via signal transduction through MHC class II molecules.",1991
s26736,the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase glycoproteins of human parainfluenza virus type 1 and sendai virus have high structure-function similarity with limited antigenic cross-reactivity.,"the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase glycoproteins of human parainfluenza virus type 1 and sendai virus have high structure-function similarity with limited antigenic cross-reactivity.. Human parainfluenza virus type 1 (hPIV-1) is closely related to Sendai virus on the basis of cross-reactivity of antisera. We examined this association further by using monoclonal antibodies to the Sendai virus hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) glycoprotein to determine the relationship between overall protein structure and the hemagglutination and neuraminidase functions. Of 10 monoclonal antibodies representing four nonoverlapping antigenic sites on the HN of Sendai virus, only 4 from two sites cross-reacted with hPIV-1, indicating a limited conservation of epitopes. One of these four inhibited the hemagglutinating activity of hPIV-1 comparably to Sendai virus, but none appreciably inhibited the neuraminidase activity of hPIV-1. The ability of some of these monoclonal antibodies to inhibit only hemagglutinating or neuraminidase activity of either virus provided evidence for two separate active sites on the HN molecule. To determine the overall structural relationship of the HNs of hPIV-1 and Sendai virus, we cloned and sequenced the HN gene of hPIV-1. The HN clone was made from genomic RNA and was identified by hybrid-arrested in vitro translation of mRNA. The predicted HN protein sequence of hPIV-1 was identical in length to that of Sendai virus and had a shared identity of 72%. There was a marked conservation of structural elements (cysteines, prolines, and glycines), which would predict a similar molecular conformation. However, there were 10 potential glycosylation sites on the HN of hPIV-1, compared with 5 on Sendai virus. Some of these sites may be responsible for the inability of the Sendai virus monoclonal antibodies to cross-react. The results of our study support a close structure-function relationship between hPIV-1 and Sendai virus but suggest limited antigenic cross-reactivity.",1990

A lambda gt11 expression library of Tn5-tagged invasion plasmid pWR110 (from Shigella flexneri serotype 5, strain M90T-W) contained a set of recombinants encoding a 60-kilodalton protein (designated IpaH) recognized by rabbit antisera raised against S. flexneri invasion plasmid antigens (J. M. Buysse, C. K. Stover, E. V. Oaks, M. M. Venkatesan, and D. J. Kopecko, J. Bacteriol. 169:2561-2569, 1987). Southern blot analysis of wild-type S. flexneri serotype 5 invasion plasmid DNA (pWR100) digested with various combinations of five restriction enzymes and hybridized with defined ipaH probes showed complex hybridization patterns resulting from multiple copies of the ipaH gene on pWR100. DNA sequence analysis of a 2.9-kilobase (kb) EcoRI fragment directing IpaH antigen synthesis in plasmid recombinant pWR390 revealed an open reading frame coding for a 532-amino-acid protein (60.8 kilodaltons); this size matched well with the estimated size of IpaH determined by Western blot analysis of M90T-W cells and maxicell analysis of Escherichia coli HB101(pWR390) transformants. Examination of the amino acid sequence of IpaH revealed a hydrophilic protein with six evenly spaced 14-residue (L-X2-L-P-X-L-P-X2-L-X2-L) repeat motifs in the amino-terminal end of the molecule. Southern blot analysis of HindIII-digested pWR100 DNA probed with defined segments of the pWR390 2.9-kb insert demonstrated that the multiple band hybridization pattern resulted from repeats of a significant portion of the ipaH structural gene in five distinct HindIII fragments (9.8, 7.8, 4.5, 2.5, and 1.4 kb). Affinity-purified IpaH antibody, used to monitor the expression of the antigen in M90T-W cells grown at 30 and 37 degrees C, showed that IpaH synthesis was not regulated by growth temperature.",1990
s26841,the use of anti-cd3 and anti-cd28 monoclonal antibodies to clone and expand human antigen-specific t cells.,"the use of anti-cd3 and anti-cd28 monoclonal antibodies to clone and expand human antigen-specific t cells.. Antigen-specific T cell clones are useful reagents for studies of the fine specificity of antigen recognition and of potential therapeutic use in adoptive immunotherapy for human viral and malignant diseases. Culture methods which require antigen and APC for stimulation can be problematic for the generation and long-term growth of human virus and tumor-specific T cells. We have developed an alternative culture method using monoclonal antibodies to T cell activation molecules, CD3 and CD28, as stimulation to efficiently grow CD4+ and CD8+ antigen-specific T cells from single progenitors and expand T cell clones in long-term culture. This method alleviates the requirement for large amounts of viral or tumor antigens and MHC compatible APC to sustain the growth of virus and tumor-specific T cell clones, and, as demonstrated for CD8+ CMV-specific cytotoxic T cells, overcomes the difficulties cloning CD8+ T cells using virally infected cells as antigen-presenting cells. T cell clones generated and maintained with monoclonal antibody stimulation are rapidly expanded and retain antigen-specific responses after 3 months in culture, suggesting this approach may prove useful for growing large numbers of antigen-specific T cell clones for cellular immunotherapy.",1990
s26866,protective potential of hepatitis b virus antigens other than the s gene protein.,"protective potential of hepatitis b virus antigens other than the s gene protein.. The current recombinant hepatitis B vaccines are safe and effective. However, the occurrence of non-responders and difficulties in immunizing immunodeficient persons suggest the need for further improvements. Recent data suggest that the pre-S2 and pre-S1 domains of hepatitis B virus induce protective antibodies. The good T-helper cell response against pre-S1 epitopes would also improve the antibody response against the small surface antigen protein. An even better T-cell priming could be achieved by including hepatitis B core (HBc) proteins or peptides. An optimal immunogen would contain all three proteins comprising hepatitis B surface antigen in their natural conformation and glycosylation as well as the major T-cell epitopes of HBc.",1990
s26892,characterization of the gene and an antigenic determinant of equine herpesvirus type-1 glycoprotein 14 with homology to gb-equivalent glycoproteins of other herpesviruses.,"characterization of the gene and an antigenic determinant of equine herpesvirus type-1 glycoprotein 14 with homology to gb-equivalent glycoproteins of other herpesviruses.. The gene encoding glycoprotein 14 (gp14) of equine herpesvirus type 1 was sequenced. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a complete transcription unit composed of a CAT box, a TATA box, a ribosome-binding sequence, a polyadenylation signal and an open reading frame (ORF) of 2940 bp transcribed from left to right. The amino acid (aa) sequence deduced from this ORF corresponded to that of a protein with 979 aa and had the characteristic features of membrane gp including a 20-aa signal sequence at the N terminus, a 743-aa surface domain, a 40-aa membrane anchoring region, a 108-aa hydrophilic cytoplasmic domain at the C terminus and eleven potential sites for N-linked glycosylation. An unusual feature of this protein was an exceptionally long (66aa) sequence, with a preponderance of hydrophilic residues, preceding the hydrophobic signal core. An antigenic determinant recognized by an anti-gp14 monoclonal antibody was present in the N terminus of the postulated surface domain. Comparison of gp 14 with the gp of other herpesviruses indicated that gp14 was highly homologous to corresponding gp of pseudorabies (gII), bovine herpesvirus (gI), varicella-zoster virus (gII), as well as of herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus and human cytomegalovirus (gB).",1990
s27042,four major antigenic sites of the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus are located on the amino-terminal half of spike glycoprotein s.,"four major antigenic sites of the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus are located on the amino-terminal half of spike glycoprotein s.. Four major antigenic sites have been delineated on the spike protein (S) of the porcine enteric coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in previous topological studies using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Correlation of these sites with the physical structure of the protein was achieved by use of different approaches. Recombinant pEX plasmids directing the synthesis of various fused S polypeptides were constructed. A hybrid protein containing nine S-specific residues (363 to 371) was shown to express site C epitopes. The other sites were localized through study of the antigenic activity of fragments generated by controlled cleavage of the native protein with different endopeptidases. Two identified cleavage products of 26K and 13K, immunoreactive to site A-B- and site D-specific MAbs respectively, could be aligned on the S primary structure according to N-terminal sequence data. This led us to propose that the major neutralization domain A-B is contained in a region of approximately 200 residues with residue 506 as its N boundary. Similarly, site D epitopes should be located within a stretch of 130 residues, starting at 82 residues from the N terminus. Point mutations identified by direct RNA sequencing of neutralization-resistant mutants were consistent with the proposed location of these sites.",1990
s27104,regions of the streptococcus sobrinus spaa gene encoding major determinants of antigen i.,"regions of the streptococcus sobrinus spaa gene encoding major determinants of antigen i.. Surface protein antigen A (SpaA), also called antigen B, antigen I/II, or antigen P1, is an abundant cell envelope protein that is the major antigenic determinant of Streptococcus sobrinus and other members of the Streptococcus mutans group of cariogenic bacteria. This laboratory has previously reported the cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of a BamHI restriction fragment of S. sobrinus DNA containing most of the spaA gene (pYA726) and encoding antigen I. Regions of spaA encoding immunodeterminants of antigen I were analyzed by either deletion mapping or expressing selected restriction fragments from the trc promoter. SpaA proteins produced by mutants harboring nested deletions, constructed by BAL 31 exonuclease treatment at a unique SstI site located towards the 3' end of the gene, were examined by Western immunoblot with rabbit serum against SpaA from S. sobrinus. Only SpaA polypeptides larger than 56 kilodaltons reacted with anti-SpaA serum. Various restriction fragments of the region of spaA encoding the antigenic determinants were cloned into an expression vector. The immunoreactive properties of the polypeptides encoded by those fragments indicated that expression of the immunodominant determinant required topographically assembled residues specified by noncontiguous regions located within 0.48-kilobase PvuII-to-SstI and 1.2-kilobase SstI-to-HindIII fragments which were adjacent on the spaA map.",1990
s27145,cloning and expression of a membrane antigen of entamoeba histolytica possessing multiple tandem repeats.,"cloning and expression of a membrane antigen of entamoeba histolytica possessing multiple tandem repeats.. Entamoeba histolytica causes amebic dysentery and amebic liver abscess, major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. We have used differential hybridization screening to isolate an E. histolytica-specific cDNA clone. The cDNA was found to encode a serine-rich E. histolytica protein (SREHP) containing multiple tandem repeats. The structural motif of SREHP resembles some of the repetitive antigens of malarial species, especially the circumsporozoite proteins. A recombinant trpE fusion protein containing the tandem repeats of SREHP was recognized by immune serum from a patient with amebiasis, demonstrating that SREHP is a naturally immunogenic protein. An antiserum raised against the recombinant fusion protein specifically bound to two distinct bands with apparent molecular masses of 46 and 52 kDa in a crude preparation of E. histolytica trophozoite membranes. This antiserum also inhibited E. histolytica trophozoite adhesion to Chinese hamster ovary cells in vitro. The ability to isolate E. histolytica-specific genes, and to express those genes in Escherichia coli, may be important in studying the molecular basis of E. histolytica pathogenesis and for the future development of vaccines.",1990
s27175,"antigenic, sequence, and crystal variation in influenza b neuraminidase.","antigenic, sequence, and crystal variation in influenza b neuraminidase.. The neuraminidase (NA) genes of influenza B viruses B/Maryland/59, B/Hong Kong/8/73, B/Singapore/222/79, B/Oregon/5/80, B/USSR/100/83, B/Victoria/3/85, B/Leningrad/179/86, B/Memphis/6/86, and B/Memphis/3/89 have been sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences show high variability in the stalk domain of the NA, but a surprising degree of sequence conservation in the head region which carries all the antigenic and enzyme activity. The variable region coding for the neuraminidase stalk also translates into a variable section in the overlapping NB polypeptide, which is coded from a second reading frame that overlaps the first 100 amino acids of NA. The influenza B NAs are antigenically distinguishable with monoclonal antibodies in neuraminidase-inhibition tests, even when there is only one amino acid sequence difference. However, seven of nine escape mutants selected with monoclonal antibodies were distinguished only by the antibody used for selection. When NA heads of influenza B viruses are crystallized, there are remarkable differences in crystal morphology between neuraminidases which have very few sequence changes.",1990
s27262,expression of t cell antigen receptor heterodimers in a lipid-linked form.,"expression of t cell antigen receptor heterodimers in a lipid-linked form.. The interaction of the T cell receptor for antigen (TCR) with its antigen-major histocompatibility complex ligand is difficult to study because both are cell surface multimers. The TCR consists of two chains (alpha and beta) that are complexed to the five or more nonpolymorphic CD3 polypeptides. A soluble form of the TCR was engineered by replacing the carboxyl termini of alpha and beta with signal sequences from lipid-linked proteins, making them susceptible to enzymatic cleavage. In this manner, TCR heterodimers can be expressed independently of the CD3 polypeptides and in significant quantities (0.5 milligram per week). This technique seems generalizable to biochemical and structural studies of many other cell surface molecules as well.",1990
s27289,genes for plasmodium falciparum surface antigens cloned by expression in cos cells.,"genes for plasmodium falciparum surface antigens cloned by expression in cos cells.. Two genes encoding membrane antigens of Plasmodium falciparum were isolated by transient expression in mammalian cells and selection with human immune sera from African adults exposed to P. falciparum malaria. COS-7 cells were transfected with a plasmid expression library constructed from P. falciparum genomic DNA, and cells expressing reactive malaria antigens on their surface were enriched by adherence to antibody-coated dishes. One of the genes isolated is distinctive in that it does not contain repeat sequences typical of many malarial genes cloned by immunoscreening of bacterial expression libraries. The second gene apparently encodes a polymorphic version of the P. falciparum merozoite surface antigen Ag513, since the two sequences are identical in the 5' and 3' coding regions but diverge completely in the center. The COS-7 expression system provides an alternate means for cloning genes encoding malarial membrane antigens by using those antibodies in complex immune sera that bind membrane-associated, nondenatured molecules.",1990
s27299,cloning and expression in escherichia coli of a protective antigen of erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae.,"cloning and expression in escherichia coli of a protective antigen of erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae.. Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is a primary pathogen of swine and turkeys and sporadic cause of disease in a variety of other hosts, including humans. A genomic library of the highly virulent strain of E. rhusiopathiae E1-6P was constructed in the expression-cloning vector lambda gt11 and screened with serum from a pig convalescent from an E. rhusiopathiae experimental infection. Immunoreactive clones were screened for their ability to protectively immunized mice. Two clones, lambda gt11/ersA and lambda gt11/ersB, were obtained that protected mice against challenge with E. rhusiopathiae E1-6P. Antisera against the recombinant clones reacted with polypeptides of molecular weights 66,000, 64,000, and 43,000 in detergent-solubilized surface antigen preparations and whole-cell lysates of E. rhusiopathiae. These polypeptides were also the major antigens recognized by convalescent pig serum when reacted with the same preparations. Western immunoblot and Southern blot analysis revealed that the cloned genes and gene products were present in all of the E. rhusiopathiae strains tested.",1990
s27334,immortalization and transformation of human fibroblasts by regulated expression of polyoma virus t antigens.,"immortalization and transformation of human fibroblasts by regulated expression of polyoma virus t antigens.. We have established conditions for the immortalization of human fibroblasts by the large T antigen of the rodent virus polyoma. This allows the mechanism of immortalization to be studied, without interference by transformation events, in cells with relatively stable chromosomes. Large T antigen could immortalize human fibroblasts if expression was driven by a heterologous promoter like the immediate early promoter/enhancer of cytomegalovirus or the inducible mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV) promoter. Using the latter promoter and dexamethasone, three clones were obtained, the immortalized phenotype of which was strictly dependent on the induction of T-antigen expression. At least one of these clones became mortal after removal of the inducing agent. The expression of large T antigen was paralleled by PCNA gene expression, as shown by nuclear run-off transcription, whereas none of a number of other known proto-oncogenes was influenced in its activity. Immortalized fibroblasts were readily transformed by polyoma virus middle T antigen expressed from the MMTV promoter or by the activated c-Ha-ras oncogene. The reversibility of immortalization and transformation is considered.",1990
s27404,"antigenic conservation of the 15,000-dalton outer membrane lipoprotein pcp of haemophilus influenzae and biologic activity of anti-pcp antisera.","antigenic conservation of the 15,000-dalton outer membrane lipoprotein pcp of haemophilus influenzae and biologic activity of anti-pcp antisera.. A gene from Haemophilus influenzae encoding an outer membrane lipoprotein of about 15,000 daltons and which comigrates with the peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL) of H. influenzae on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis has been previously reported and designated pcp gene, and its product has been designated PCP. in order to obtain specific immunologic probes for the analysis of PCP expression, cellular location, and antigenic conservation in H. influenzae, pcp was fused to the lac polylinker region of plasmid pUC19 and the hybrid gene was expressed in Escherichia coli. PCP purified from these cells was used to generate rabbit and mouse polyclonal antisera and mouse monoclonal antibody against PCP. Western immunoblot analysis with anti-PCP monoclonal antibody demonstrated that PCP is present and antigenically conserved in 30 tested strains of H. influenzae, including 27 clinical nontypeable strains. Polyclonal antiserum against PCP killed 9 of 11 clinical H. influenzae strains in a complement-mediated bactericidal assay, and bactericidal activity was additive with bactericidal activity of antisera against PAL. These results indicate that PCP is a potentially valuable component for a subunit vaccine against nontypeable H. influenzae disease, especially in combination with PAL or other components.",1990
s27413,antigenic relationships among human rotaviruses as determined by outer capsid protein vp4.,"antigenic relationships among human rotaviruses as determined by outer capsid protein vp4.. cDNA clones representing the VP4 gene of symptomatic human rotavirus strain KU (VP7 serotype 1) or DS-1 (VP7 serotype 2) or asymptomatic human rotavirus strain 1076 (VP7 serotype 2) were constructed and inserted into a baculovirus expression vector under the control of the polyhedrin promoter. The resulting recombinants expressed the appropriate authentic VP4 rotavirus outer capsid protein. Guinea pigs immunized with these VP4 proteins developed antibodies that neutralized infectivity of the rotavirus from which the immunizing VP4 was derived. These antisera were then used in neutralization tests to define the extent and distribution of VP4 antigenic polymorphism among human rotaviruses. Three distinct serotypes and one subtype of the VP4 outer capsid protein were identified among 17 human rotavirus strains that had previously been assigned to five distinct VP7 serotypes. For the most part, VP4 serotype segregated independently of VP7 serotype. Ten strains of human rotavirus that were associated with symptomatic infection and that exhibited VP7 serotype 1, 3, 4, or 9 specificity, each possessed a VP4 of the same serotype and subtype, designated VP4 serotype 1A. Both symptomatic human rotavirus strains with VP7 serotype 2 specificity were related by neutralization to the VP4 serotype 1A strains and were classified as a subtype of VP4 serotype 1--i.e., serotype 1B--since viruses of serotype 1A appeared to be prime strains. Four human rotavirus strains that were recovered from healthy infants in newborn nurseries in which virus transmission persisted over a long interval, belonged to VP7 serotype 1, 2, 3, or 4, but each strain possessed the same VP4 antigenic specificity that was designated VP4 serotype 2. Finally, a single strain of symptomatic human rotavirus of VP7 serotype 1 specificity possessed a unique VP4 that was provisionally classified as VP4 serotype 3 but this remains to be confirmed because neutralization tests were performed in only one direction. Among the 10 rotavirus strains whose VP4 gene was previously sequenced, there was complete concordance between assignment of VP4 serotype by neutralization and classification according to VP4 amino acid homology. Thus, rotaviruses that exhibited a VP4 amino acid homology of 89% or greater belonged to the same VP4 serotype and subtype as determined by neutralization. Finally, evidence was obtained that the serotype-specific domain is located on the VP8 subunit of VP4.",1990
s27452,effects of major histocompatibility genes and antigen delivery on induction of protective mucosal immunity to e. acervulina following immunization with a recombinant merozoite antigen.,"effects of major histocompatibility genes and antigen delivery on induction of protective mucosal immunity to e. acervulina following immunization with a recombinant merozoite antigen.. Intramuscular immunization with the recombinant p250 surface antigen of Eimeria acervulina merozoite (rEAMZp250) or oral inoculation with live recombinant Escherichia coli expressing the rEAMZp250 protein resulted in antigen-specific T-cell and humoral responses and conferred a significant reduction in mucosal parasitism compared to immunization with the negative control antigen preparation. Among the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (B)-congenic chickens receiving intramuscular immunization, strain .6-2 (B2-B2) showed significant (P less than 0.05) protection to live E. acervulina challenge compared to the other strains examined. In contrast, strains .C-12(B12B12) and .P-13 (B13B13) showed significant protection among the groups given live recombinant E. coli. In general, strains showing enhanced T-cell responses to the rEAMZp250 protein were better protected compared to those showing minimal or no T-cell responses. Thus the results suggest that the B haplotypes of the host and the mode of antigen presentation influence the outcome of protection following an immunization of chickens with recombinant coccidial antigen.",1990
s27532,frequency of variant antigens in giardia lamblia.,"frequency of variant antigens in giardia lamblia.. Giardia lamblia undergoes antigenic variation. The rate of antigenic variation and the size of the variant antigen repertoire were estimated in clones of Giardia lamblia which reexpresses surface variant antigens that are characteristics of its parent. Calculations were based on determinations of the number of trophozoites expressing defined or nondefined epitopes as well as the total number of trophozoites in newly established clones. The rate of appearance of variant antigens containing defined epitopes was expressed as the number of generations until the first trophozoite expressing a defined epitope appeared. In clones of isolate WB, tested because their major surface variant antigens were largely nondefined, variants expressing epitopes recognized by Mabs 6E7 or 3F6 appeared after approximately 12 generations. Variants expressing epitopes recognized by Mab 5C1 appeared at about 13 generations, significantly greater than for the other epitopes. The rate of antigenic variation was studied in another isolate, GS/M, whose surface epitope repertoire differs from that of isolate WB. A single epitope recognized by Mab G10/4 was tested. Trophozoites reexpressing this epitope first appeared after about 6.5 generations, significantly less than in WB. Therefore, the single epitope studied in isolate GS/M is reexpressed much more frequently than those of WB. In isolate WB, the epitopes recognized by Mab 6E7 and 3F6 tended to appear at the same time. The median number of variant antigens in WB was estimated to lie between 20.5 and 184.",1990
s27567,in situ hybridization of prostate-specific antigen mrna in human prostate.,"in situ hybridization of prostate-specific antigen mrna in human prostate.. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) mRNA was detected by in situ hybridization utilizing a 428 base pair [35S]-labelled cDNA probe from the 3' noncoding region of the PSA gene. Thirty six fresh surgical specimens were collected from patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy for carcinoma of the prostate. Quantitative analysis of the levels of PSA mRNA in both the benign and malignant tissues was performed using an IBAS 2000 Image Analysis System. The results of this study demonstrated that there is a significant decrease in the expression of PSA mRNA in the carcinoma tissue when compared to the benign epithelium. The average binding (number of silver grains/1 x 10(4) microns. 2) for 20 specimens of malignant epithelium was 475 +/- 161 and 586 +/- 140 for 16 specimens of benign epithelium (p less than 0.05). Eleven patients had both benign and malignant tissue from the same surgical specimen available for study. From these paired specimens, the PSA mRNA expression was also significantly reduced in the malignant epithelium when compared to the benign epithelium, 445 +/- 162 and 588 +/- 135 respectively (p less than 0.005). The PSA protein was detected using a monoclonal antibody to PSA with an immunohistochemical staining technique. The PSA protein expression paralleled the expression of the PSA mRNA in the majority of the tissue sections. Many of the tumor specimens showed a heterogeneous expression of PSA, whereas all of the benign epithelium had a uniform high level of PSA expression. In conclusion, PSA mRNA and protein are located only within the glandular epithelial tissue, the expression of PSA protein parallels that of the PSA mRNA, and both the PSA protein and PSA mRNA are significantly decreased in the malignant epithelium when compared to benign prostatic epithelium.",1990
s27590,endothelial cell antigens recognized by xenoreactive human natural antibodies.,"endothelial cell antigens recognized by xenoreactive human natural antibodies.. Hyperacute rejection of vascularized, discordant xenografts is generally though to be initiated when natural antibodies of the recipient bind to endothelial cells of the donor organ. While rejection of such xenografts always occurs, the molecular targets of natural antibodies have not been elucidated. The aim of the experiments reported herein was to identify the molecules on porcine endothelial cells that would be recognized by human natural antibodies if a porcine organ were to be transplanted into a human (or rhesus). Toward the end, it was shown that the major components recognized by human serum on porcine endothelial cells are glycoproteins of 115kDa, 125kDa, and 135kDa (gp115/135). Reactivity with these glycoproteins was abrogated by enzymatic cleavage of N-linked oligosaccharides or of subterminal beta-D-gal residues suggesting that the determinants are located on oligosaccharides rather than on the polypeptide cores. The biological relevance of gp115/135 was suggested by experiments in which a similar series of components was shown to be recognized by rhesus natural antibodies and by the absorption of such antibodies by perfusion of porcine kidneys. The gp115/135 antigens were present on porcine platelets but not porcine RBC or lymphocytes. Nevertheless, purified RBC and lymphocytes absorbed human anti-gp115/135, suggesting that human natural antibodies recognize the same or crossreactive carbohydrate determinants expressed on the surface of a variety of cells.",1990
s27724,"mutations in conformation-dependent domains of herpes simplex virus 1 glycoprotein b affect the antigenic properties, dimerization, and transport of the molecule.","mutations in conformation-dependent domains of herpes simplex virus 1 glycoprotein b affect the antigenic properties, dimerization, and transport of the molecule.. Glycoprotein B (gB) is a component of the herpes simplex virus 1 envelope that is required for penetration of virions into cells. We constructed 11 mutants in the gB gene by deleting the carboxy terminus of the molecule, inserting linkers into the ectodomain and intracellular region, and creating point mutations in cysteine residues. To identify regions of the molecule that affect the formation of epitopes on gB, we cloned the mutated genes into a eukaryotic expression vector, transfected them in COS-1 cells, and reacted the gene products in immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation tests with a panel of monoclonal antibodies. Our findings are as follows. (i) The ectodomain of gB between residues 600 and 690 is highly antigenic and contains residues that specify 8 continuous epitopes and affect the conformation of 12 discontinuous epitopes. Residues that form a novel neutralizing domain and affect the assembly of gB dimers are contained in this region. Dimerization of gB does not require the transmembrane region or the intracellular carboxy terminus. (ii) Transport of the insertion mutants was aberrant and depended on the site mutagenized. Insertions of linkers at residues 391, 413, and 479 of the ectodomain precluded the binding of neutralizing antibodies that recognize residues in four discontinuous-epitope domains; the latter mutant in intact gB was not translocated to the cell surface. In contrast, insertions at residue 600 of the ectodomain and 810 of the intracellular domain did not affect the conformation-dependent epitopes or gB transport. (iii) Substitution of serines for cysteine residues in a discontinuous-epitope domain in the midregion of gB altered the conformation of both proximal and distal sites. Seven epitopes were lost by mutagenesis of cysteine 382 and 4 epitopes by mutagenesis of cysteine 334. Together with previous findings, these results indicate that the ectodomain of gB contains three topographically distinct neutralizing regions, one of continuous and two of discontinuous epitopes. The continuous-epitope domains that map at the amino terminus are not altered by distal mutations. In contrast, the domains of discontinuous epitopes, assembled by juxtaposing residues on the surface of gB, are affected by proximal and distal mutations that alter the antigenic structure, processing, and surface transport of gB.",1991
s27781,nucleotide sequence of the yersinia pestis gene encoding f1 antigen and the primary structure of the protein. putative t and b cell epitopes.,nucleotide sequence of the yersinia pestis gene encoding f1 antigen and the primary structure of the protein. putative t and b cell epitopes.. The plasmid-located gene caf1 encoding the capsular antigen fraction 1 (F1) of Yersinia pestis was cloned and sequenced. The gene codes for a 170 amino acid peptide with a deduced Mr of 17.6 kDa. The signal peptide sequence was highly homologous to the E. coli consensus signal sequence. The F1 was assumed to have beta-sheet structure for the most part. The region located between amino acids 100 and 150 was suggested to contain putative antigenic determinants and to stimulate T cells.,1990
s27862,sequence of the gene encoding the major neutralization antigen (vp7) of serotype 10 rotavirus.,"sequence of the gene encoding the major neutralization antigen (vp7) of serotype 10 rotavirus.. The sequence of the gene encoding the major neutralization antigen (VP7) of the type member (bovine virus strain B223) of the proposed serotype 10 of rotavirus has been determined. This was done using a rapid new strategy involving direct sequencing by primer extension of cDNA generated from the relevant virus gene (gene 8) using a combined reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction. The sequence obtained is 1062 bp in length and contains a single long open reading frame capable of encoding a protein of 326 amino acids. Comparison of the sequence to that of the corresponding gene of the other major virus serotype found in cattle, serotype 6, showed that it was approximately 25% divergent at the nucleotide level and 18% divergent at the amino acid level.",1991
s27971,serological responses to the b subunit of shiga-like toxin 1 and its peptide fragments indicate that the b subunit is a vaccine candidate to counter action of the toxin.,"serological responses to the b subunit of shiga-like toxin 1 and its peptide fragments indicate that the b subunit is a vaccine candidate to counter action of the toxin.. The B subunit of Shiga toxin and Shiga-like toxin (SLT-1) and its fragments are potentially immunogenic and may generate protective humoral responses against the action of these toxins. We have analyzed the antibody response of rabbits immunized with pure B subunit of SLT-1 or synthetic fragments of the subunit. The immune response to the native B subunit was found to be largely directed at conformational epitopes. More importantly, rabbits immunized with the B subunit were protected from a lethal challenge with SLT-1, indicating that the B subunit represents an excellent vaccine candidate to counter the effects of Shiga toxin and SLT-1 in humans. Polyclonal antibodies against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 28 to 40 of the B subunit neutralized the cytotoxicity of SLT-1 towards Vero cells. This region is thus exposed in the native state of the B subunit. The sequence specificity of other antipeptide antisera also provides clues to the state of folding and assembly of the B subunit. Antisera to synthetic peptides representing the N- and C-terminal regions of the SLT-1 B subunit did not cross-react with native B subunit but strongly recognized denatured forms of the protein. Finally, the monoclonal antibody 13C4 was shown to bind to a discontinuous epitope expressed only on the native form of the protein. These immunological reagents can be used to probe the conformational state of the B subunit and the holotoxin as it relates to their functional properties.",1991
s27975,cytokine-induced proliferation and immunoglobulin production of human b lymphocytes triggered through their cd40 antigen.,"cytokine-induced proliferation and immunoglobulin production of human b lymphocytes triggered through their cd40 antigen.. Human resting B lymphocytes enter a state of sustained proliferation when incubated with both mouse fibroblastic L cells stably expressing Fc gamma RII/CDw32 and anti-CD40 antibodies. We have explored the effects of 11 recombinant human cytokines (CKs) on induced cell proliferation and immunoglobulin (Ig) production. Interleukin 4 (IL-4) was the only CK able to enhance anti-CD40-induced B cell multiplication as measured by enumeration of viable cells, and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) further stimulated this induced proliferation. IL-4 enhanced the production of IgM and IgG by B cells and induced them to produce IgE. Combinations of IL-4 and IL-2 resulted in the production of large amounts of IgM and IgA. Interestingly, IFN-gamma did not inhibit the production of IgE by cells stimulated with anti-CD40 and IL-4. None of the tested CK combinations resulted in the production of large quantities of IgG. Therefore, this new culture system represents a unique model to study isotype regulation in highly purified human B lymphocytes, in addition to allowing the generation of long-term factor-dependent human B cell lines.",1991
s28025,stable t-p53 complexes are not required for replication of simian virus 40 in culture or for enhanced phosphorylation of t antigen and p53.,"stable t-p53 complexes are not required for replication of simian virus 40 in culture or for enhanced phosphorylation of t antigen and p53.. We generated a number of simian virus 40 (SV40) mutants with single amino acid substitutions in T antigen between residues 388 and 411. All but one mutant (398LV) replicated like wild-type SV40 and gave rise to normal-size plaques. Three different mutations at residue 402 (Asp to Glu, Asn, or His) totally prevented the formation of stable complexes with the cellular protein p53 in monkey cells but had no effect on virus replication. Only one other mutation in this region, involving residue 401 (Met to Thr), slightly inhibited the formation of T-monkey p53 complexes. The three mutant T antigens with substitutions at residue 402 also formed no stable complexes with human p53 but generated low levels of complexes with mouse p53. These results indicate that residue 402 is critical for binding to monkey and human p53 proteins and is important for binding to mouse p53. We suggest that it is one of several points of contact. In cells infected with any one of the three residue 402 mutant viruses. T antigen and p53 became increasingly phosphorylated, as they were in cells infected with wild-type virus. Our data therefore show that stable T-p53 complexes are not required for replication of SV40 in culture or for enhanced phosphorylation of either protein.",1991
s28120,antigenic structure of bovine growth hormone: location of a growth enhancing region.,"antigenic structure of bovine growth hormone: location of a growth enhancing region.. Site-directed antisera generated by peptide immunization have been used to study the antigenicity of bovine growth hormone (bGH). Prediction of sequential antigenic sites has been performed using secondary structure information derived from the 'Protean' prediction routine. The structures predicted by this programme agree closely with the corresponding structure of GH recently derived from crystallographic studies. We have previously shown that the binding of monoclonal antibodies of particular epitope specificity to human or bovine GH results in significant enhancement of hormonal activity in vivo; however, the sites recognized by these antibodies were not known. Here we identify a sequence region, corresponding to a loop structure joining helices 3 and 4, which, is associated with the growth enhancement phenomenon. Antisera raised to either of two overlapping peptides (residues 120-140 and 134-154) significantly increase the biological activity of GH in vivo. Antisera directed to other regions on the GH molecule failed to demonstrate this property. Coincidentally, the sites recognized by the growth-enhancing anti-peptide antisera overlap with the site on GH which is highly susceptible to proteolytic cleavage; such cleavage has been shown in some cases to result in hormone enhancement.",1991
s28145,"molecular cloning, characterization, and nucleotide sequence of the rfc gene, which encodes an o-antigen polymerase of salmonella typhimurium.","molecular cloning, characterization, and nucleotide sequence of the rfc gene, which encodes an o-antigen polymerase of salmonella typhimurium.. The rfc gene of Salmonella typhimurium was located in a 1.75-kb HindIII fragment and restored wild-type lipopolysaccharide synthesis ability to both an older rfc point mutant and new rfc::IS10 mutants. DNA sequencing of the HindIII fragment revealed an open reading frame which could encode a protein of 407 amino acids with an Mr of 47,472 and also revealed potential translation signals. Modulator codons accounted for 12.5% of the total codon content, providing a possible explanation for the nondetectability of the protein in subcellular systems. Secondary structure analysis suggested the presence of transmembrane beta-sheet structures, implying a possible role for the protein in translocation of hydrophilic O-antigen-containing materials. Salmonella strains of groups A, B, and D1 contained rfc-homologous DNA, but strains of groups C1, C2, C3, D2, and E2 did not.",1991
s28161,the 5' noncoding region of the type 2 poliovirus vaccine strain contains determinants of attenuation and temperature sensitivity.,"the 5' noncoding region of the type 2 poliovirus vaccine strain contains determinants of attenuation and temperature sensitivity.. Intratypic recombinants of P2/Sabin and P2/117, a neurovirulent vaccine revertant, have been generated in vitro using infectious cDNA clones and used to demonstrate that strong determinants of the attenuation and temperature-sensitive phenotypes of P2/Sabin reside in the 5' 492 nucleotides. In this region of the genome the viruses differ only at nucleotides 437 and 481. The ts phenotype associated with the 5' noncoding region is expressed at different temperatures in different cell lines, suggesting an involvement of cellular factors which may be species specific. Suppression of both the ts and attenuation phenotypes correlates with an A-G mutation at nucleotide 481, although other changes are also involved.",1991
s28192,the nucleoproteins of human parainfluenza virus type 1 and sendai virus share amino acid sequences and antigenic and structural determinants.,"the nucleoproteins of human parainfluenza virus type 1 and sendai virus share amino acid sequences and antigenic and structural determinants.. The complete nucleotide sequence of the nucleoprotein (NP) gene of human parainfluenza virus type 1 (hPIV-1) was determined from a cDNA clone of mRNA. The mRNA is 1683 nucleotides long (excluding polyadenylic acid) and encodes a protein of 524 amino acids with a predicted Mr of 57,548. An amino acid identity of 83% was predicted between the NPs of the human pathogen hPIV-1 and the murine paramyxovirus, Sendai virus, compared to 72% similarity at the level of the nucleotide sequence. In contrast, the amino acid sequence identity between the NPs of hPIV-1 and hPIV-3 was 59%, suggesting a more distant evolutionary relationship. The NP amino acid sequences of hPIV-1 and Sendai virus were highly conserved in the amino-terminal half of the molecule, in which 395 of the first 420 amino acids were identical. Of 11 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) targeted against the Sendai virus NP, five cross-reacted with the hPIV-1 NP. The MAbs that cross-reacted recognize epitopes within regions of high amino acid similarity between the NPs of the two viruses. Also, five of the eight MAbs raised against hPIV-1 NP cross-reacted with Sendai virus NP. Taken together, our observations suggest that the essential amino acid sequence determinants of the NP structures of hPIV-1 and Sendai virus are conserved despite changes in their nucleotide sequences during evolution. This implies that there was a selective pressure to maintain the important functional domains of the protein.",1991
s28209,recombinant virus vaccine-induced siv-specific cd8+ cytotoxic t lymphocytes.,"recombinant virus vaccine-induced siv-specific cd8+ cytotoxic t lymphocytes.. Evidence indicates that cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) may be important in containing the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the infected host. Although the use of recombinant viruses has been proposed as an approach to elicit protective immunity against HIV, the ability of recombinant viral constructs to elicit CD8+ CTL responses in higher primates has never been demonstrated. A live recombinant virus, vaccinia-simian immunodeficiency virus of macaques (SIVmac), was used to determine whether such a genetically restricted, T lymphocyte-mediated antiviral response could be generated in a primate. Vaccinia-SIVmac vaccination elicited an SIVmac Gag-specific, CD8+ CTL response in rhesus monkeys. These CTLs recognized a peptide fragment that spans residues 171 to 195 of the Gag protein. The rhesus monkey major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I gene product restricting this CTL response was defined. Both the vaccinated and SIVmac-infected monkeys that shared this MHC class I gene product developed CTLs with the same Gag epitope specificity. These findings support the use of recombinant virus vaccines for the prevention of HIV infections in humans.",1991
s28266,"the gene encoding the stem cell antigen, cd34, is conserved in mouse and expressed in haemopoietic progenitor cell lines, brain, and embryonic fibroblasts.","the gene encoding the stem cell antigen, cd34, is conserved in mouse and expressed in haemopoietic progenitor cell lines, brain, and embryonic fibroblasts.. The human haemopoietic cell surface antigen, CD34, is a 105 - 120 kd cell surface glycoprotein whose stage-specific expression by stem cells and lineage-specific progenitor cells suggests a role in regulating early events in blood cell differentiation. A murine gene and cDNA encoding a closely homologous protein have been isolated. The gene is organized in eight exons in 22 kb of DNA. The first exon lies in a GC- and CpG-rich island. The sequence of the gene and the cDNA predict a 382 amino acid-long protein containing an N-terminal signal peptide and one transmembrane region 73 amino acids from the C-terminus. The extracellular part of the protein contains: a 140 amino acid-long-N-terminal region, 40% of whose residues are serine or threonine potential attachment sites for O-linked carbohydrate, as well as five potential attachment sites for N-linked carbohydrate. Proximal to the extracellular membrane there is a 79 amino acid-long cysteine-rich region. The homology with the human sequence is highest in the intracellular domain (90% amino acid identity) and lowest in the N-terminal region (43% amino acid identity). The protein is not homologous with any other proteins currently in the databases. The expression of the murine gene by a number of haemopoietic progenitor cell lines suggests that the CD34 function in haemopoiesis may be conserved between man and mouse. The high level of expression in a number of embryonic fibroblast cell lines and in brain imply a function outside of haemopoiesis.",1991
s28303,immunomodulation of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis by antibodies to the antigen-ia complex.,"immunomodulation of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis by antibodies to the antigen-ia complex.. Autoimmune diseases occur when T lymphocytes become activated on recognizing self antigen linked to the autologous class II molecule of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The resulting complex of antigen MHC T-cell receptor could be a target for treatment of autoimmune diseases. Studies in which each component is blocked separately might be limited by interference in non-relevant immune responses that either use the same set of T-cell-receptor V gene segments or are linked to the same MHC. We report here an attack by a specific antibody on the unique antigenic site formed by the binding of two components of the trimolecular complex, the autoantigen bound to the self MHC. We tested its effect in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, an acute neurological autoimmune disease which is widely regarded as a model for autoimmune disorders and which is mediated by CD4+ T cells recognizing myelin basic protein (BP), or its peptides, in association with self Ia. We made monoclonal antibodies which bound only the complex of BP and I-As. These antibodies blocked the proliferative response in vitro to the encephalitogenic determinant of BP and reduced the response to intact BP, without affecting the response to a nonrelevant antigen-purified protein derivative of tuberculin presented on syngeneic macrophages. They also inhibited experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in H-2s mice. Hence, antibodies directed specifically to the autoantigen-Ia complex, may offer a highly selective and effective treatment in autoimmune diseases.",1991
s28455,failure of recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing plasmodium falciparum antigens to protect saimiri monkeys against malaria.,"failure of recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing plasmodium falciparum antigens to protect saimiri monkeys against malaria.. Saimiri sciurus monkeys were immunized at multiple sites with recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing Plasmodium falciparum antigen genes and boosted 4 weeks later. Control monkeys were immunized with a thymidine kinase-negative vaccinia virus mutant. Two weeks later, all of the monkeys were challenged by intravenous inoculation of P. falciparum (Indochina strain) parasites. A group of unimmunized monkeys was challenged in parallel. All of the monkeys that received vaccinia virus recombinants or the control virus produced good anti-vaccinia virus antibody responses. However, those that received a single construct containing ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (RESA) given at eight sites did not produce significant antibody to any of the three major RESA repeat epitopes after immunization but were primed for an enhanced antibody response after challenge infection with P. falciparum. Most of the monkeys produced detectable antibodies to the RESA epitopes after challenge infection. One group of monkeys was immunized with four constructs (expressing RESA, two merozoite surface antigens [MSA-1 and MSA-2], and a rhoptry protein [AMA-1]), each given at two sites. While these monkeys failed to produce significant antibody against MSA-2 or AMA-1 after immunization, they produced enhanced responses against these antigens after challenge infection. Immunization involved an allelic form of MSA-2 different from that present in the parasite challenge strain, so that the enhanced responses seen after challenge infection indicated the presence of T-cell epitopes common to both allelic forms. No groups of monkeys showed any evidence of protection against challenge, as determined by examination of the resulting parasitemias.",1991
s28469,identification of a neutralization epitope on the envelope gp46 antigen of human t cell leukemia virus type i and induction of neutralizing antibody by peptide immunization.,"identification of a neutralization epitope on the envelope gp46 antigen of human t cell leukemia virus type i and induction of neutralizing antibody by peptide immunization.. We have generated a number of mAb against various epitopes on the external envelope glycoprotein, gp46, of human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) from a WKA rat immunized with a recombinant vaccinia virus containing the HTLV-I env gene. Among these mAb, one group of mAb, represented by a mAb designated LAT-27, could neutralize the infectivity of HTLV-I, as determined by a HTLV-I-mediated cell fusion inhibition assay. LAT-27 also interfered with transformation of normal T lymphocytes by HTLV-I in vitro. An antibody-binding assay using overlapping synthetic oligopeptides showed that LAT-27 bound specifically to 10-mer peptides that contained the gp46 amino acid sequence 191-196 (Leu-Pro-His-Ser-Asn-Leu). Antibodies from HTLV-I+ humans interfered with the binding of LAT-27 to gp46 Ag. Sera from rabbits immunized with a LAT-27-reactive peptide, 190-199, conjugated with OVA, but not sera from OVA-immunized rabbits, reacted with gp46 Ag and neutralized infectivity of HTLV-I. These results show that the HTLV-I neutralization epitope recognized by LAT-27 locates to the gp46 amino acids 191-196, and that immunization with a peptide containing the LAT-27 epitope can elicit an HTLV-I neutralizing antibody response.",1991
s28477,"self-assembled b19 parvovirus capsids, produced in a baculovirus system, are antigenically and immunogenically similar to native virions.","self-assembled b19 parvovirus capsids, produced in a baculovirus system, are antigenically and immunogenically similar to native virions.. B19 parvovirus is pathogenic in humans, causing fifth disease, transient aplastic crisis, some cases of hydrops fetalis, and acquired pure red cell aplasia. Efforts to develop serologic assays and vaccine development have been hampered by the virus's extreme tropism for human bone marrow and the absence of a convenient culture system. We constructed recombinants containing either the major (VP2) or minor (VP1) structural proteins of B19 in a baculovirus-based plasmid, from which the polyhedrin gene had been deleted; these recombinant plasmids were used to generate recombinant infectious baculovirus. Subsequent infection of insect cells in vitro resulted in high-level expression of either B19VP1 or VP2. Parvovirus capsids were obtained by self-assembly in cell cultures coinfected with either VP1- and VP2-containing baculoviruses or, surprisingly, VP2-containing baculoviruses alone. Empty B19 capsids composed of VP1 and VP2 could replace serum virus as a source of antigen in a conventional immunoassay for detection of either IgG or IgM antiparvovirus antibodies in human serum. Immunization of rabbits with capsids composed of VP1 and VP2 resulted in production of antisera that recognized serum parvovirus on immunoblot and neutralized parvovirus infectivity for human erythroid progenitor cells. Baculovirus-derived parvovirus antigen can substitute for scarce viral antigen in immunoassays and should be suitable as a human vaccine.",1991
s28504,synthesis and expression in escherichia coli of cistronic dna encoding an antibody fragment specific for a salmonella serotype b o-antigen.,"synthesis and expression in escherichia coli of cistronic dna encoding an antibody fragment specific for a salmonella serotype b o-antigen.. A 1460-bp DNA encoding the two chains of the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) portion of a monoclonal antibody have been chemically synthesized and expressed in Escherichia coli. The antibody, Se155-4, is specific for a Salmonella serogroup B O-antigen and its crystal structure is under investigation. The genes were synthesized according to a strategy that allows for easy manipulation in genetic engineering studies of the Fab-binding site. Each gene is preceded by the ompA secretory signal and a ribosome-binding site, and has been expressed from the two-cistron DNA under the control of the lac promoter. Active Fab of 50 kDa with an inter-chain disulfide bond has been isolated from the periplasm of E. coli in a one-step affinity purification in high yield (2 micrograms/ml of cells). The bacterially produced Fab is as active as purified mouse Fab in antigen-binding and competitive immunoassays. This is the first example of a completely synthetic Fab gene and provides an ideal system to probe the nature of antigen binding by anti-carbohydrate antibodies.",1991
s28537,liposomes as carriers of antigens and adjuvants.,"liposomes as carriers of antigens and adjuvants.. Liposomes have been widely used as carriers of protein or peptide antigens. Antigenic materials can be attached to the outer surface, encapsulated within the internal aqueous spaces, or reconstituted within the lipid bilayers of the liposomes. The natural tendency of liposomes to interact with macrophages has served as the primary rationale for utilizing liposomes as carriers of antigens. Liposomes also serve as carriers of a variety of adjuvants and mediators, including lipid A, muramyl dipeptide and its derivatives, interleukin-1, and interleukin-2. Research utilizing in vitro cell culture models has demonstrated that liposomes containing both appropriate antigens and major histocompatibility gene complex molecules can induce antigen-specific genetically restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Liposomes induce immune reactions through classical interactions with antigen presenting cells. However, modelling experiments have also demonstrated that liposomes can even substitute for antigen presenting cells, and cell-free genetically restricted and nonrestricted presentation of antigens by liposomes to helper T lymphocytes has been demonstrated. Liposomes are successful for inducing potent immunity in vivo and they are now being employed in numerous immunization procedures and as vehicles for candidate vaccines.",1991
s28552,transduction and expression of the human carcinoembryonic antigen gene in a murine colon carcinoma cell line.,"transduction and expression of the human carcinoembryonic antigen gene in a murine colon carcinoma cell line.. A cell line derived from the mouse colon adenocarcinoma, MC-38, has been transduced with a retroviral construct containing complementary DNA encoding the human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene. MC-38, which forms tumors in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice, has been extensively studied as a target for active immunotherapy. Individual transduced clones that express high levels of cell surface CEA were isolated, and two clones, termed MC-38-ceal and MC-38-cea2, were extensively characterized. The levels of CEA found on the surface of these clones were considerably higher than that found in a moderately differentiated human colon carcinoma cell line (WiDr) and were comparable to those found on the human colon carcinoma cell lines GEO and CBS (among the highest CEA-expressing cells reported). Further analysis demonstrated that the CEA expressed in the MC-38-cea1 clone had a similar molecular weight to native CEA (Mr 180,000), but the MC-38-cea2 cell line expressed a single Mr 70,000 glycosylated immunoreactive product. Seven anti-CEA monoclonal antibodies were found to react with both clones. The CEA gene present in the MC-38-cea2 clone was partially sequenced and was found to contain a deletion of two of the three repeated domains present in CEA. These results provide a basis for future studies to map immunodominant epitopes of CEA and to develop a syngeneic model system that may aid in the design of reagents and protocols to study active and passive immunotherapy directed against a carcinoma expressing human CEA.",1991
s28554,hormonal regulation of prostate-specific antigen messenger rna in human prostatic adenocarcinoma cell line lncap.,"hormonal regulation of prostate-specific antigen messenger rna in human prostatic adenocarcinoma cell line lncap.. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a member of the kallikrein gene family and is expressed exclusively in human prostatic epithelial cells. PSA protein has been an important biological marker for prostate cancers. Until now, very little was known about the regulation of PSA expression in prostatic cells. In this study, we have developed a specific oligonucleotide probe which recognizes PSA but not the human glandular kallikrein. This is crucial because both PSA and human glandular kallikrein are expressed in the prostate at relatively high levels and have high nucleotide sequence homology (greater than 82%). Utilizing a S-labeled PSA-specific probe, PSA mRNA was localized within the glandular epithelium of the prostate. Northern blot analysis detected a single 1.6-kilobase transcript in LNCaP cells, a cell line derived from a human prostate adenocarcinoma metastasis. Therefore, LNCaP cells were used to study the androgenic effects on PSA mRNA expression. A time course study demonstrated that PSA mRNA was induced by mibolerone (a nonmetabolizable synthetic androgen) and reached maximal levels after 9 h. The induction of PSA mRNA required as little as 0.3 nM mibolerone. In addition to mibolerone, PSA mRNA could be induced by the natural androgen, dihydrotestosterone, but not by the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, or the synthetic estrogen, diethylstilbestrol. Moreover, in the presence of dihydrotestosterone, PSA mRNA was depressed by hydroxyflutamide (an antiandrogen). These results suggest strongly that the androgenic effects on PSA mRNA in LNCaP cells may be via the function of the androgen receptor.",1991
s28616,antigenicity of rabies virus glycoprotein.,"antigenicity of rabies virus glycoprotein.. Although the number of antigenic sites on the rabies virus glycoprotein that have been described regularly increases with time, no attempt has been made to carefully evaluate the relative importance of each of these sites. Here we provide a more precise description of the antigenicity of the protein in mice of the H-2d haplotype; we developed this description by using 264 newly isolated monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and a collection of neutralization-resistant (MAR) mutants. Most of the MAbs (97%) recognized antigenic sites previously described as II and III. One minor antigenic site separated from site III by three amino acids, including a proline, was identified (minor site a). Despite their proximity, there is no overlap between site III and minor site a; i.e., site III-specific MAR mutants were neutralized by the six MAbs defining minor site a, and vice versa. One of our MAbs, 1D1, reacted with sodium dodecyl sulfate-treated glycoprotein in Western blots (immunoblots) under reducing conditions and was therefore probably directed against a linear epitope, A MAR mutant selected with this MAb was still neutralized by MAbs of other specificities. This linear epitope was called G1 (G, Gif).

s28646,immunological characterization of recombinant antigens isolated from a mycobacterium avium lambda gt11 expression library by using monoclonal antibody probes.,"immunological characterization of recombinant antigens isolated from a mycobacterium avium lambda gt11 expression library by using monoclonal antibody probes.. Nontuberculous mycobacteria, particularly Mycobacterium avium, have been isolated from a significant percentage of patients with AIDS. Early detection of M. avium infection is difficult, and treatment regimens are often ineffective. Much needs to be learned about antigens and factors responsible for immunity to and pathogenesis of the disease. Specific antigens and diagnostic procedures for infection need to be developed. To address some of these problems, we have generated 25 different monoclonal antibodies against a serovar 4 strain of M. avium isolated from a patient with AIDS. Protease sensitivity studies have demonstrated that each of these antibodies recognizes a protein-associated epitope. Immunoblot analyses suggest that seven of these monoclonal antibodies react specifically with M. avium and M. intracellular epitopes. Immunoreactive bacteriophages were identified from an M. avium lambda gt11 expression library with two of these monoclonal antibodies (3808 C3 and 3954 B12). Lambda lysogens, generated from the immunoreactive bacteriophages, overproduced beta-galactosidase fusion proteins which were reactive with the two monoclonal antibodies in immunoblot assays. The purified fusion proteins were shown to elicit skin test reactions in sensitized guinea pigs.",1991

Infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae are a major worldwide health problem. In particular, nontypeable strains of H. influenzae are a common cause of otitis media in infants and children. A vaccine to prevent these infections would result in the prevention of substantial morbidity and cost savings. A problem in identifying an appropriate vaccine antigen has been the enormous antigenic heterogeneity among nontypeable strains of H. influenzae. The present study was undertaken to characterize the conservation of the P6 outer membrane protein (approximately 16,000 daltons) among strains of H. influenzae. A total of 20 type b strains and 20 nontypeable strains of diverse geographic and clinical origins was studied. Three approaches were taken. (i) Antigenic determinants recognized by monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were present on P6 in all 40 strains tested. The molecular weight of P6 was identical in all strains. (ii) Comparison of the DNA sequences of the P6 genes from three epidemiologically and serologically unrelated strains demonstrated 100% homology at the amino acid level and 97 to 99% homology at the nucleotide level. (iii) Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis demonstrated that the P6 gene and flanking sequences were highly conserved among all strains. These three independent series of experiments indicated that the P6 protein is highly conserved among strains of H. influenzae. P6 should receive serious consideration for inclusion in a vaccine to prevent infections caused by nontypeable H. influenzae.",1991
s28702,aromatic-dependent salmonella as live vaccine presenters of foreign epitopes as inserts in flagellin.,"aromatic-dependent salmonella as live vaccine presenters of foreign epitopes as inserts in flagellin.. Synthetic oligonucleotides specifying amino acid sequences identified as epitopes of various foreign antigens (cholera toxin subunit B, hepatitis B surface protein and others) have been inserted at an EcoRV-EcoRV deletion site in a cloned Salmonella flagellin gene; the resulting plasmids, when placed in flagellin-negative Escherichia coli or Salmonella sp. strains, caused production of flagellin expressing the epitope. If the chimeric flagellin allowed formation of flagella, the epitope was exposed at the surface of the flagellar filaments. A delta aroA flagellin-negative S. dublin live vaccine strain given plasmids carrying various chimeric flagellin genes was administered to mice, etc. Serum antibody specific for the foreign epitope was in all cases evoked by parenteral administration; oral route administration was effective in the case of two epitopes of hepatitis B surface protein but not effective for several other epitopes. Several i.p. inocula of the live vaccine strain with an insert corresponding to the 15 N-terminal amino acids of the M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes type 5 evoked M-specific antibody with opsonic activity, and the mice were (incompletely) protected against a lethal challenge of S. pyogenes type 5. The non-virulence of Salmonella sp. strains with complete blocks in the aromatic biosynthesis pathway, even for animals with genetically determined or other defects in host defences, can be completely accounted for by their requirement for p-aminobenzoic acid, since non-leaky pabB mutations caused similar attenuation. Two transposon insertions at aroE caused little or no attenuation, presumably because they did not result in complete block of the relevant step in biosynthesis. The limited growth of delta aroA strains in mouse tissues parallels that which precedes the bacteriostasis caused by addition of a sulphonamide to a growing broth culture of a sulphonamide-sensitive strain; the final cessation of growth in each case presumably results from inability to initiate new protein chains with a formyl-methionine unit when the original folic acid content of the bacteria has been diluted out by residual growth.",1990
s28780,ctla-4 is a second receptor for the b cell activation antigen b7.,"ctla-4 is a second receptor for the b cell activation antigen b7.. Functional interactions between T and B lymphocytes are necessary for optimal activation of an immune response. Recently, the T lymphocyte receptor CD28 was shown to bind the B7 counter-receptor on activated B lymphocytes, and subsequently to costimulate interleukin 2 production and T cell proliferation. CTLA-4 is a predicted membrane receptor from cytotoxic T cells that is homologous to CD28 and whose gene maps to the same chromosomal band as the gene for CD28. It is not known, however, if CD28 and CTLA-4 also share functional properties. To investigate functional properties of CTLA-4, we have produced a soluble genetic fusion between the extracellular domain of CTLA-4 and an immunoglobulin C gamma chain. Here, we show that the fusion protein encoded by this construct, CTLA4Ig, bound specifically to B7-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells and to lymphoblastoid cells. CTLA4Ig also immunoprecipitated B7 from cell surface 125I-labeled extracts of these cells. The avidity of 125I-labeled B7Ig fusion protein for immobilized CTLA4Ig was estimated (Kd approximately 12 nM). Finally, we show that CTLA4Ig was a potent inhibitor of in vitro immune responses dependent upon cellular interactions between T and B lymphocytes. These findings provide direct evidence that, like its structural homologue CD28, CTLA-4 is able to bind the B7 counter-receptor on activated B cells. Lymphocyte interactions involving the B7 counter-receptor are functionally important for alloantigen responses in vitro.",1991

Following occupancy of the T cell receptor by antigen, T cell proliferation and lymphokine production are determined by a second costimulatory signal delivered by a ligand expressed on antigen presenting cells. The human B cell activation antigen B7, which is expressed on antigen presenting cells including activated B cells and gamma interferon treated monocytes, has been shown to deliver such a costimulatory signal upon attachment to its ligand on T cells, CD28. We have cloned and sequenced the murine homologue of the human B7 gene. The predicted murine protein has 44% amino acid identity with human B7. The greatest similarity is in the Ig-V and Ig-C like domains. Murine B7 mRNA was detected in murine hematopoietic cells of B cell but not T cell origin. Cells transfected with murine B7 provided a costimulatory signal to human CD28+ T lymphocytes. These results demonstrate the costimulatory activity of murine B7 and provide evidence that the ligand attachment site is conserved between the two species.",1991
s29077,human monoclonal antibodies against blood group antigens preferentially express a vh4-21 variable region gene-associated epitope.,"human monoclonal antibodies against blood group antigens preferentially express a vh4-21 variable region gene-associated epitope.. An anti-idiotypic antibody has been raised which recognizes human immunoglobulins with cold agglutinin activity of anti-I/i specificity. The pattern of reactivity of the antibody indicates that the structural basis for the epitope is located in the VH4-21 gene segment of the VHIV family, which is preferentially utilized by these cold reactive antibodies. Using this antibody, epitope expression was investigated in a panel of 72 human monoclonal allo-antibodies specific for human blood group antigens, as compared with a control panel of 39 randomly selected human monoclonal IgM antibodies of unknown specificities. The anti-blood group panel included 44 IgM and 28 IgG monoclonal antibodies against a variety of blood group antigens including the A antigen, Rh C, c, D, E, e, G antigens, and the Kidd antigens Jka and Jkb. The epitope was expressed by 64% (28/44) of the IgM anti-blood group antibodies and by 21% (6/28) of the IgG antibodies, but by only 7.7% (3/39) of the control IgM antibodies. These data indicate that the human alloimmune response to blood group antigens is biased in the use of VH gene families, with a preference for the VH4-21 gene segment of the VHIV family, or closely related gene segments. The fact that this mirrors the findings for the autoimmune cold agglutinins suggests a link in immunoglobulin gene usage between antibodies against structurally diverse antigens on the red cell surface.",1991
s29085,modified-live infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus vaccine expressing monomer and dimer forms of foot-and-mouth disease capsid protein epitopes on surface of hybrid virus particles.,"modified-live infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus vaccine expressing monomer and dimer forms of foot-and-mouth disease capsid protein epitopes on surface of hybrid virus particles.. Modified-live, attenuated infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) hybrid virus vaccines have been constructed by inserting in the major IBRV glycoprotein gIII gene chemically synthesized deoxyribonucleotide sequences encoding the bovine growth hormone signal sequence and monomeric or dimeric forms of the foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) VP 1 epitope sequences. The foreign DNA sequences were inserted at the N-terminal end of the IBRV gIII coding sequence and were driven by the IBRV gIII promoter. The sequences encoding the first 38 and the first 21 amino acids of the IBRV gIII were deleted from the hybrid viruses containing inserts of the monomeric and dimeric FMDV epitope sequences, respectively, to avoid redundant signal sequences. Plaque immunoassay experiments with guinea pig and bovine anti-FMDV peptide antisera, and with anti-IBRV gIII monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that IBRV-FMDV fusion proteins were expressed in virus-infected MDBK cells. Immunoelectron microscopy analyses demonstrated that the IBRV-FMDV fusion proteins were expressed as repeated structures on the surface of virus particles. Experiments showed that the recombinant IBRV-FMDV viruses protected cattle from IBRV (Cooper) challenge and induced anti-FMDV peptide antibodies, thereby demonstrating that the FMDV epitopes were expressed in vivo.",1991
s29266,the product of the proto-oncogene c-kit (p145c-kit) is a human bone marrow surface antigen of hemopoietic precursor cells which is expressed on a subset of acute non-lymphoblastic leukemic cells.,"the product of the proto-oncogene c-kit (p145c-kit) is a human bone marrow surface antigen of hemopoietic precursor cells which is expressed on a subset of acute non-lymphoblastic leukemic cells.. A monoclonal antibody (17F11) was raised by immunization of a Balb/c mouse with leukemic blasts from a patient with acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). This antibody recognizes most leukemic blasts of myeloid but not of lymphoid lineage and no peripheral blood cells. By screening NIH-3T3 fibroblasts transfected with the human proto-oncogene c-kit (NIH-3T3/hckit) it could be shown that 17F11 specifically recognizes the gene product P145c-kit. Immunofluorescence analysis on normal hemopoietic cells revealed that 17F11 weakly stains 1-3% of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC). By FACS sorting and colony assays it could be shown that granulocyte--macrophage progenitor cells could be enriched 10-20-fold, granulocyte progenitors 50-80-fold, and erythroid and multipotential progenitor cells 15-20-fold, in the 17F11 positive fraction. Double fluorescence analysis revealed that P145c-kit is co-expressed on 40-60% of the CD34 positive BMMNC. Finally, these data show that P145c-kit is expressed on blast cells from most patients with ANLL (26/30) and chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis (7/9), but is absent on blasts from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia expressing the T-, B-lineage, or common ALL phenotypes.",1991
s29313,immunogenicity of multiple antigen peptides (map) containing t and b cell epitopes of the repeat region of the p. falciparum circumsporozoite protein.,"immunogenicity of multiple antigen peptides (map) containing t and b cell epitopes of the repeat region of the p. falciparum circumsporozoite protein.. The immunogenicity of multiple antigen peptides (MAP) constructs containing T and B cell epitopes of the repeat region of the P. falciparum circumsporozoite (CS) protein was examined in vitro, using a human T cell clone, and in vivo, using four different strains of mice. All the MAP constructs that contained the T cell epitope, (DPNANPNVDPNANPNV), stimulated proliferation and interferon-gamma production by a human T cell clone specific for this epitope which is located in the 5' end of the repeat region of the P. falciparum CS protein. These human T cells did not recognize MAP that contained only the B cell epitope, (NANP)3, which is located in the 3' repeat region. Optimal antibody responses were obtained in mice immunized with MAP containing four copies of tandemly arranged T and B cell epitopes, (TB)4. The murine immune response to the MAP constructs was genetically restricted. Mice of a high responder strain, C57BL, recognized both the 5' and 3' repeat sequences in the MAP as T, as well as B, cell epitopes and developed very high anti-MAP and anti-sporozoite antibody titers. A/J and C3H mice, which were intermediate responders, developed lower antibody titers which varied according to the orientation of the T vs. the B cell epitopes within the MAP constructs. BALB/c mice were nonresponders and did not develop antibodies following immunization with any of the MAP constructs containing the 5' and 3' repeats of the P. falciparum CS protein.",1991
s29392,antigen-specific therapy of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis by soluble class ii major histocompatibility complex-peptide complexes.,"antigen-specific therapy of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis by soluble class ii major histocompatibility complex-peptide complexes.. Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis is a T-cell-mediated, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II gene-linked autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. To develop therapies that will specifically inactivate only the autoantigen-reactive T cells, mice were treated with soluble MHC class II molecules that had been complexed with encephalitogenic peptides. Intravenous injections of 300 micrograms of complexes consisting of encephalitogenic peptide 91-103 of myelin basic protein plus I-As protein on day 0, 4, and 7 were effective in preventing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Similarly, administration of 45 micrograms of I-As protein complexed to peptide 139-151 from proteolipoprotein on day 1, 4, and 7 prevented mortality and significantly reduced paralysis induced by immunization with the encephalitogenic proteolipoprotein peptide. Histological examination of sections of animal brains revealed that treatment with I-As protein plus myelin basic protein 91-103 peptide prevents the development of inflammatory lesions characteristic of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Thus, treatment with MHC-self-peptide complexes could serve as a highly specific therapeutic modality in treating autoimmune disease when the putative autoantigen and the MHC restricting elements are known.",1991
s29423,expression of epstein-barr virus nuclear antigens in anti-igm-stimulated b cells following recombinant vaccinia infection and their recognition by human cytotoxic t cells.,"expression of epstein-barr virus nuclear antigens in anti-igm-stimulated b cells following recombinant vaccinia infection and their recognition by human cytotoxic t cells.. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) recognizing Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigens (EBNA) are an important host defence mechanism in restricting the proliferation of EBV-infected B cells. Previously, B-type lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) infected with vaccinia recombinants encoding for the EBNA proteins have been used to identify A-type-specific CTL epitopes. However, to localize the CTL epitopes encoded by both A- and B-type transformants, B-type LCL are an inappropriate host for vaccinia. In the present study, an alternative host cell for vaccinia infection is described. Initial studies demonstrated that anti-IgM (mu-chain specific)-stimulated human B cells allowed vaccinia virus to replicate more efficiently than either phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes (PHA blasts) or CTL and expressed EBNA proteins following recombinant vaccinia infection. Furthermore, the presentation and recognition of target epitopes expressed on vaccinia-infected anti-mu-stimulated B cell blasts were comparable to that on similarly infected LCL. Anti-mu-stimulated B cells were used to define the CTL epitopes recognized by a panel of CTL clones from an EBV-immune donor. Using recombinant vaccinia-infected anti-mu-stimulated B cells, the CTL response from this donor was mapped to the EBNA6 protein. Most importantly, in vitro stimulation of unfractionated mononuclear cells with vaccinia-infected anti-mu B cells activated a memory CTL response. Based on the vaccinia results, screening of peptides from EBNA6 localized the epitope for the majority of the EBNA6-specific CTL clones to the sequence EENLLDFVRFM, apparently in association with HLA-B44. This work clearly demonstrates that anti-mu-stimulated B cells not only provide an efficient model for localizing the CTL epitope(s) but also raises the possibility of reactivating a memory T-cell response to any gene product expressed by recombinant vaccinia.",1991
s29482,intranasal immunization using the b subunit of the escherichia coli heat-labile toxin fused to an epitope of the bordetella pertussis p.69 antigen.,"intranasal immunization using the b subunit of the escherichia coli heat-labile toxin fused to an epitope of the bordetella pertussis p.69 antigen.. The plasmid pBRD026, which directs expression of the B subunit of the Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin (LTB), was modified so that DNA encoding epitopes could be inserted at the 3' end of the gene. An oligonucleotide linker containing restriction sites for BglII and SpeI was inserted at the SpeI site at the 3' end of the LTB gene to form plasmid pFV1. This linker also encodes the amino acid sequence Gly-Pro-Gly-Pro which we propose acts as a 'hinge' between the LTB and the foreign epitope. Oligonucleotides specifying an epitope from the Bordetella pertussis P.69 outer membrane protein were cloned into pFV1 to form pFV169. The resultant fusion protein (LTB69) was partially purified from the periplasm of E. coli strains in a soluble pentameric form which could bind GM1 gangliosides. Mice immunized intranasally with purified LTB69 produced antibodies against both LTB and the P.69 protein. In addition, ELISPOT assays demonstrated the presence of LTB-specific and P.69-specific antibody-secreting cells in the lungs of immunized mice.",1991
s29491,the promoter of the prostate-specific antigen gene contains a functional androgen responsive element.,"the promoter of the prostate-specific antigen gene contains a functional androgen responsive element.. Expression of prostate-specific antigen (PA) mRNA was tested at various time periods after incubation of the human prostate tumor cell line LNCaP with the synthetic androgen R1881. Androgen-stimulated expression was observed within 6 h after addition of R1881 to the cells. Run-on experiments with nuclei isolated from LNCaP cells showed that expression of the PA gene could be regulated by R1881 on the level of transcription. DNase I footprints of the promoter region of the PA gene (-320 to +12) with nuclear protein extracts from LNCaP cells showed at least four protected regions. The protected areas include the TATA-box, a GC-box sequence, and a sequence AGAACAgcaAGTGCT at position -170 to -156, which closely resembles the reverse complement of the consensus sequence GGTACAnnnTGTTCT for binding of the glucocorticoid receptor and the progesterone receptor. Fragments of the PA promoter region were cloned in front of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene and cotransfected with an androgen receptor expression plasmid into COS cells in a transient expression assay. CAT activity of COS cells grown in the presence of 1 nM R1881 was compared to untreated controls. A 110-fold induction of CAT activity was found if a -1600 to +12 PA promoter fragment was used in the construct. By further deletion mapping of the PA promoter a minimal region (-320 to -155) was identified as being essential for androgen-regulated gene expression. Mutation of the sequence AGAACAgcaAGTGCT (at -170 to -156) to AAAAAAgcaAGTGCT almost completely abolished androgen inducibility of the reporter gene constructs. One or more copies of the sequence AGAACAgcaAGTGCT cloned in front of a thymidine kinase promoter-CAT reporter gene confers androgen regulation to the reporter gene. These findings provide strong evidence for transcription regulation of the PA gene by androgens via the sequence AGAACAgcaAGTGCT. Interestingly, in addition to the AGAACAgcaAGTGCT element, an upstream region (-539 to -320) is needed for optimal androgen inducibility of the PA promoter.",1991
s29525,oral immunization with salmonella typhi ty21a-based clones expressing vibrio cholerae o-antigen: serum bactericidal antibody responses in man in relation to pre-immunization antibody levels.,"oral immunization with salmonella typhi ty21a-based clones expressing vibrio cholerae o-antigen: serum bactericidal antibody responses in man in relation to pre-immunization antibody levels.. Previous studies have shown that oral immunization with Salmonella typhi Ty21a-based clones expressing Vibrio cholerae O-antigen elicits serum antibody responses against the foreign polysaccharide in human volunteers. These responses are conveniently assayed by complement-dependent bacteriolysis of V. cholerae. In this report the bactericidal responses generated by two such clones are analysed in relation to the pre-immunization titres of various serum antibodies. A significant association was found, in that recipients with higher prevaccine titres of anti-V. cholerae bactericidal antibodies were less likely to register significant bactericidal responses following immunization. These results are discussed in relation to the concept of vaccine exclusion.",1991
s29590,identification and characterization of vaccinia virus genes encoding proteins that are highly antigenic in animals and are immunodominant in vaccinated humans.,"identification and characterization of vaccinia virus genes encoding proteins that are highly antigenic in animals and are immunodominant in vaccinated humans.. Vaccinia virus (VV) is a potent immunogen, but the nature of VV proteins involved in the activation of the immune response of the host is not yet known. By screening a lambda gt11 expression library of rabbitpox virus DNA with serum from humans vaccinated against smallpox or with serum from VV-immunized animals, we identified several VV genes that encode highly antigenic viral proteins with molecular masses of 62, 39, 32, 25, 21, and 14 kDa. It was found that VV proteins of 62, 39, 25, and 21 kDa are part of the virus core, while proteins of 32 and 14 kDa are part of the virus envelope. All of these proteins were synthesized at late times postinfection. Proteins of 62 and 25 kDa were produced by cleavage of larger precursors of 95 kDa (p4a) and 28 kDa, respectively. The 21-kDa protein was the result of a cleavage of p4a, presumably at amino acid Gly-697. DNA sequence analysis, in comparison with the known nucleotide sequence of VV, provided identification of the corresponding open reading frames. Expression of the viral genes in Escherichia coli was used to monitor which of the viral antigens elicit immunodominant responses and the location of antigenic domains. Three viral antigens of 62, 39, and 32 kDa exhibited immunodominant characteristics. The most antigenic sites of 62 and 39 kDa were identified at the N terminus (amino acids 132 to 295) and C terminus (last 103 amino acids), respectively. Immunization of mice with the 62-, 39-, or 14-kDa antigenic proteins conferred different degrees of protection from VV challenge. Proteins of 32 and 14 kDa induced cellular proliferative responses in VV-infected mice. Our findings demonstrate the nature of VV proteins involved in the activation of host immune responses after vaccination, provide identification of the viral gene locus, and define structural and immunological properties of these antigenic VV proteins.",1992
s29699,shared human melanoma antigens. recognition by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in hla-a2.1-transfected melanomas.,"shared human melanoma antigens. recognition by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in hla-a2.1-transfected melanomas.. Three predominantly CD8+ CTL lines, TIL 501, TIL 620, and TIL 660, were generated from three HLA-A2+ melanoma patients by culturing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in 1000 U/ml IL-2. These tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes lysed 12 of 18 HLA-A2+ autologous and allogeneic melanomas, but none of 20 HLA-A2-negative melanomas. They also did not lyse the MHC class I negative lymphoma-leukemia cell lines, Daudi, K562, or HLA-A2+ non-melanoma cell lines including PHA or Con A-induced lymphoblast, fibroblast, EBV-transformed B cell, Burkitt's B cell lymphoma, and colon cancer cell lines. Autologous and allogeneic melanoma lysis was inhibited by anti-CD3, by anti-MHC class I, and by anti-HLA-A2 mAb, indicating recognition of shared tumor Ag among melanoma cell lines in a TCR-dependent, HLA-A2-restricted manner. Six HLA-A2-negative melanoma cell lines obtained from five HLA-A2-negative patients were co-transfected with the HLA-A2.1 gene and pSV2neo. All 17 cloned transfectants expressing cell surface HLA-A2 molecules, but none of 12 transfectants lacking HLA-A2 expression, were lysed by these three HLA-A2-restricted, melanoma-specific CTL. Lysis of the HLA-A2+ transfectants was inhibited by anti-CD3, by anti-MHC class I, and by anti-HLA-A2 mAb, indicating recognition of shared tumor Ag on transfectants in a TCR-dependent, HLA-A2-restricted manner. These results identify the HLA-A2.1 molecule as an Ag-presenting molecule for melanoma Ag. They also suggest that common melanoma Ag are expressed among melanoma patients regardless of HLA type. These findings have implications for the development of melanoma vaccines that would induce antitumor T cell responses.",1992
s30083,the cellular immune response to immunization with zona pellucida antigens.,"the cellular immune response to immunization with zona pellucida antigens.. The cellular immune response of mice to porcine and rat zona pellucida and cynomolgus macaques to porcine zona pellucida antigens was evaluated. Mice mounted a vigorous cellular response to both antigens, as determined by the T cell proliferation response in vitro. There was poor cross-reactivity to murine zonae by T cells or serum antibodies from mice immunized with rat zona pellucida. Nevertheless, ovaries from the mice immunized with rat zona had significantly fewer antral follicles than adjuvant-treated controls, suggesting that the immune response to the zona antigen disrupted follicular development. T cells from two macaques that had been immunized with porcine zona pelludica proteins proliferated in vitro in response to this antigen. Both macaques also had strong antibody responses. The patterns of urinary steroid metabolites in these animals provided clear evidence of ovarian malfunction following immunization. The data indicate that a significant cellular immune response is generated upon immunization of animals with zona pellucida antigens regardless of whether the antigens are cross reactive with the host zona antigens. Whether impaired ovarian function and follicular development are related to the cellular response must be determined in future studies.",1992
s30727,cellular and humoral immune responses against cancer: implications for cancer vaccines.,"cellular and humoral immune responses against cancer: implications for cancer vaccines.. The key issue in tumor immunology is to identify antigens as target structures for a cancer-selective immunological attack in the tumor-bearing host, resulting in tumor rejection. There is a growing detailed understanding of structural and regulatory gene alterations giving rise to candidate rejection antigens and peptides in tumor cells. As well as reviewing the development of new adjuvant and recombinant vector systems, new approaches are suggested for the construction of cancer vaccines.",1991
s30802,restoration of antigen presentation to the mutant cell line rma-s by an mhc-linked transporter.,"restoration of antigen presentation to the mutant cell line rma-s by an mhc-linked transporter.. In mammalian cells, short peptides derived from intracellular proteins are displayed on the cell membrane associated with class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The surface presentation of class I-peptide complexes presumably alerts the immune system to intracellular viral protein synthesis. Peptides derived from the cytosol must reach the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum where they are required for the assembly of stable class I molecules, and it has been proposed that the products of the two MHC-encoded ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter genes function to deliver the peptides across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. This idea is supported by experiments in which transfection of a human cell line defective in class I expression with a complementary DNA of one of these genes restored cell surface expression levels. Here we show that the complete phenotype of the mouse mutant cell line RMA-S, in which lack of surface expression of stable class I molecules correlates with an inability to present viral peptides originating in the cytosol, is repaired by the cDNA of the other transporter gene. These results are consistent with the possibility that the two transporter polypeptides form a heterodimer.",1991
s30809,influenza immunization: intranasal live vaccinia recombinant contrasted with parenteral inactivated vaccine.,"influenza immunization: intranasal live vaccinia recombinant contrasted with parenteral inactivated vaccine.. To compare the efficacy and duration of the immune response to local and systemic vaccination, Balb/c mice were vaccinated either intraperitoneally (i.p.) with an inactivated A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) vaccine or intranasally (i.n.) with a vaccinia recombinant containing the H1 gene of influenza. The i.p. inactivated vaccine stimulated high serum IgG anti-influenza titres and protected the lungs against viral challenge for the duration of the experiment (17 months). Little nasal wash IgA was induced and the noses were susceptible to challenge. Animals vaccinated i.n. with the recombinant had lower serum IgG titres and the lungs showed poor protection against challenge. Nasal wash IgA titres were higher, however, and the noses were largely protected from viral challenge for 17 months.",1991

The primary and secondary sera IgG antibody responses to ovalbumin (OVA) entrapped in biodegradable poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microparticles were compared with the responses obtained with soluble OVA. In addition, OVA in PLGA microparticles was also administered after dispersion in an immunostimulatory vehicle, Freund's incomplete adjuvant (FIA). The primary IgG responses to OVA in microparticles/FIA were significantly greater than the responses to soluble OVA from day 14 to day 42, when booster immunizations were administered. From day 49 to the end of the study at day 84, the responses to OVA, both in microparticles alone and in microparticles/FIA, were significantly greater than the responses to soluble OVA. Nevertheless, the responses obtained for OVA in microparticles or microparticles/FIA were, in general, not as high as those obtained with OVA in Freund's complete adjuvant.",1991
s30812,siv vaccines: current status. the role of the siv-macaque model in aids research.,"siv vaccines: current status. the role of the siv-macaque model in aids research.. SIV vaccines made of inactivated whole virus, modified live virus and native and recombinant envelope antigens have protected macaques against experimental infection with low doses of cell-free SIV given systemically. The few vaccinated monkeys that do become infected have tended to live longer than the infected controls. Protection against cell-associated virus has not as yet been tested. The recombinant envelope vaccines now on test have generally not been as effective as the whole virus vaccines. Post-infectious immunotherapy with SIV vaccines has been ineffective. The same whole virus and modified live virus vaccines that protect against systemic infection fail to protect against genital mucosal challenge with cell-free virus. Since sexual transmission is the major route of HIV spread on a global scale, a major effort is now required to develop vaccines in this animal model that induce genital mucosal as well as systemic immunity against infection with both cell-free and cell-associated SIV.",1991
s30879,variants of a leishmania surface antigen derived from a multigenic family.,"variants of a leishmania surface antigen derived from a multigenic family.. The promastigote surface antigen-2 (PSA-2) complex comprises a group of immunogenic surface antigens linked to the surface of the Leishmania major promastigote with glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors. The L. major genome contains at least 14 PSA-2 genes on a 950-kilobase chromosome and comprising approximately 20% of the length of this chromosome. The sequence of three independent, but incomplete, PSA-2 cDNAs and one genomic fragment encoding a complete PSA-2 coding sequence were compared. PSA-2 genes encode polypeptides exhibiting 22-25aa tandem repeat elements, threonine-rich segments which vary between genes, a conserved COOH-terminal cysteine-rich region, and a conserved GPI anchor signal sequence. PSA-2 genes appear to be transcribed in a complex manner with multiple RNAs. The complex genomic organization of PSA-2 genes is present in other members of the genus suggesting that PSA-2 function is important for the biology of Leishmania.",1991
s31131,"anthrax vaccines: past, present and future.","anthrax vaccines: past, present and future.. Most livestock vaccines in use throughout the world today for immunization against anthrax are derivatives of the live spore vaccine formulated by Sterne in 1937 and still use descendants of his strain 34F2. Credit belongs to this formulation for effective control in many countries with considerable reduction, sometimes complete elimination, of the disease in animals and, since man generally acquires it from livestock, in man also. However, there are some contraindications of its use and situations in which it cannot be easily administered, and room for development of a successor is discussed. The human vaccines, formulated for at-risk occupations and situations, date from the 1950s (UK vaccine) and 1960s (US vaccine). The rather greater need for improvement of these as compared with the veterinary vaccine stimulated valuable research during the 1980s which has led to a number of promising candidate alternatives for the future.",1991
s31673,paucity of humoral response in patients to glioma-associated antigen(s): antigen localization by immunofluorescence.,"paucity of humoral response in patients to glioma-associated antigen(s): antigen localization by immunofluorescence.. Xenogeneic immunization of freshly-prepared human glioma extracts into goats has yielded a polyclonal antiserum, which after multiple absorptions specifically identifies antigenic entities only in glioma extracts, and not in appropriate controls, both by radioimmunoassays (RIAs) and Western immunoblots. The results from the absorbed polyclonal antiserum have been confirmed by the successful generation of six stable murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) which recognize a subset of the same antigens with high specificity on immunoblots and with no apparent cross-reactivities by RIA to normal brain, serum, liver, muscle, kidney, spleen, or melanoma tissues. Moreover, the tested murine MAbs (B12C4) reveal a striking and abundant glial filament protein, possibly related to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) or other intermediate filament proteins, by frozen-section immunofluorescence. This is seen only in gliomas and is absent, or dramatically reduced, in normal human cortex. Use of potent immortalizing strain (FF41) of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) to establish antibody-secreting human lymphoblastoid lines, and the generation of mouse-human chimeric fusions, have yielded lines possessing variable supernatant human antibody secretion. Radioimmunoassays using culture supernatants, and sera from glioma patients and an normal individual, have demonstrated surprisingly similar reactivity profiles, even after a sensitive sandwich RIA employing the B6C6 murine MAb. These results suggest that, although human glioma-associated antigens, including possibly the up-regulation of GFAP expression, clearly exist, there seems to be a muted humoral response as evidenced by a paucity of tumor-specific B-cells. This may be due to antigenic shielding by the blood-brain barrier, or due to a form of immunological compromise in patients harboring these malignancies.",1991

A genomic library was constructed in a lambda gt11 vector using chromosomal DNA from a meningococcal serogroup A strain and plaques expressing the class 5C protein were recognized by screening with specific monoclonal antibodies. The opc insert was subcloned into a multicopy plasmid which induced expression of that protein in Escherichia coli as a surface-exposed major outer membrane protein. The nucleotide sequence of opc is typical of an outer membrane protein with a promoter and terminator region, a leader peptide which is cleaved during expression and a complete open reading frame. Unlike other meningococcal class 5 proteins or gonococcal P.II proteins, the sequence did not contain any pentanucleotide repeats and the sequence showed little homology to these other functionally related proteins. However, the predicted amino acid sequence of the mature protein for opc showed 27% similarity to that for a second opa gene cloned from the same meningococcal strain. This is the first report of cloning and expression of a functional meningococcal gene encoding a class 5 outer membrane protein in E. coli.",1991
s32112,a method for generating antigen-specific rat t helper cell clones.,"a method for generating antigen-specific rat t helper cell clones.. T lymphocytes play an important role in host responses to microbial antigens, and therefore, in order to facilitate studies to determine the mechanisms involved in the regulation of these responses, a method for the generation of T cell clones with specificity to microbial whole cell (WC) antigens has been developed. T cells were purified from the spleen of rats immunized with WC antigen of either the gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus mutans or the gram-negative bacterium Bacteroides gingivalis and cultured with irradiated Sephadex G-10-passed spleen (feeder) cells and the homologous WC antigen for the generation of T cell clones. Clonal growth of the T cells was maintained for up to 6 months by co-culturing similar numbers of T cells, feeder cells and WC antigen; however, the addition of exogenous interleukin-2 (IL-2) was not required. Phenotypic characterization of the cloned T cells showed that they were CD4+ T helper (Th) cells which did not express the leukocyte-common antigen, but did express receptors for 1L-2. These T cells required the presence of homologous WC antigen for growth and their antigen specificity was further confirmed by the ability of the T cells to proliferate in response to the homologous WC, but not to heterologous microbial WC, antigen. These T cells were further characterized for their ability to produce cytokines, specifically 1L-2 and interferon-gamma, and to provide help for B cell responses to microbial WC antigen. This study describes a reproducible method for the generation of rat Th cell clones with specificity to microbial WC antigens which will be valuable for defining the mechanisms involved in T cell regulation of responses to either gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria.",1991
s32198,co-expression of hepatitis b virus antigens by a non-defective adenovirus vaccine vector.,"co-expression of hepatitis b virus antigens by a non-defective adenovirus vaccine vector.. Adenovirus type 7 vaccine strain was engineered to express foreign antigens from both the E3 early promoter in the E3 region and the major late promoter inserted between the E4 region and the right inverted terminal repeat. This multiple expression vector was used to express hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The gene inserted in the E3 region was derived from the core gene of the hepatitis B virus genome. When the precore region was present, an immunoreactive group of proteins with molecular weights ranging from 15,000 to 19,000 was secreted into the media. Velocity sedimentation centrifugation of media and lysates from cells infected with recombinants containing the core gene with the precore region resulted in peaks of HBeAg at the top of the gradient where authentic HBeAg should be found. In addition to the core gene in the E3 region, the surface antigen gene of hepatitis B virus was inserted behind the major late promoter in the E4 region resulting in an adeno-hepatitis recombinant virus capable of expressing both the core gene and the HBsAg cells. Cells infected with the adeno-hepatitis recombinants could also be stained with peroxidase-conjugates after reacting to antibody against HBcAg. Inoculation of dogs with the recombinant viruses which contained the core gene, with and without the precore sequence, resulted in a significant antibody response to HBcAg/HBeAg. The dogs also produced a significant antibody response to HBsAg as well as neutralizing antibody to adenovirus.",1991
s32501,t cell memory is short-lived in the absence of antigen.,"t cell memory is short-lived in the absence of antigen.. Immunological memory has generally been ascribed to the development of long-lived memory cells that can persist for years in the absence of renewed antigenic encounter. In the experiments reported here, we have adoptively transferred memory T cells in the presence and absence of priming antigen and assessed their functional survival. The results indicate that, in contrast to the traditional view, the maintenance of T cell memory requires the presence of antigen, suggesting that memory, like tolerance, is an antigen-dependent process rather than an antigen-independent state.",1991
s32546,retention of adenovirus e19 glycoprotein in the endoplasmic reticulum is essential to its ability to block antigen presentation.,"retention of adenovirus e19 glycoprotein in the endoplasmic reticulum is essential to its ability to block antigen presentation.. The E3/19K glycoprotein of adenovirus functions to diminish recognition of adenovirus-infected cells by major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) by binding intracellular class I molecules and preventing them from reaching the plasma membrane. In the present study we have characterized the nature of the interaction between E3/19K and the H-2Kd (Kd) molecule. An E3/19K molecule genetically engineered to terminate six residues from its normal COOH terminus (delta E19), was found to associate with Kd in a manner indistinguishable from wild-type E3/19K. Unlike E3/19K, however, delta E19 was transported through the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane, where it could be detected biochemically and immunocytochemically using a monoclonal antibody specific for the lumenal domain of E3/19K. Importantly, delta E19 also differed from E3/19K in being unable to prevent the presentation of Kd-restricted viral proteins to CTLs. This is unlikely to be due to delta E19 having a lower avidity for Kd than E3/19K, since delta E19 was able to compete with E3/19K for Kd binding, both physically, and functionally in nullifying the E3/19K blockade of antigen presentation. These findings indicate that the ability of E3/19K to block antigen presentation is due solely to its ability to retain newly synthesized class I molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum.",1991
s32668,complete nucleotide sequence of the gene for a surface protein antigen of streptococcus sobrinus.,"complete nucleotide sequence of the gene for a surface protein antigen of streptococcus sobrinus.. The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene for a cell surface protein antigen (SpaA) of Streptococcus sobrinus MT3791 (serotype g) was determined. The spaA gene consisted of 4,698 bp and coded for a protein of 170,202 Da. A putative signal peptide was found in the amino-terminal end of the protein. A potential promoter sequence and a putative Shine-Dalgarno sequence preceded the open reading frame. Two internal repeating amino acid sequences were present in SpaA. One repeating region, located in the amino-terminal region, was rich in alanine, and the other, located in the central region, was rich in proline. The molecular structure of SpaA was very similar to that of the surface protein antigen of Streptococcus mutans.",1991
s32712,a gene encoding an antigen recognized by cytolytic t lymphocytes on a human melanoma.,"a gene encoding an antigen recognized by cytolytic t lymphocytes on a human melanoma.. Many human melanoma tumors express antigens that are recognized in vitro by cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) derived from the tumor-bearing patient. A gene was identified that directed the expression of antigen MZ2-E on a human melanoma cell line. This gene shows no similarity to known sequences and belongs to a family of at least three genes. It is expressed by the original melanoma cells, other melanoma cell lines, and by some tumor cells of other histological types. No expression was observed in a panel of normal tissues. Antigen MZ2-E appears to be presented by HLA-A1; anti-MZ2-E CTLs of the original patient recognized two melanoma cell lines of other HLA-A1 patients that expressed the gene. Thus, precisely targeted immunotherapy directed against antigen MZ2-E could be provided to individuals identified by HLA typing and analysis of the RNA of a small tumor sample.",1991
s32833,immunization with subunit human immunodeficiency virus vaccine generates stronger t helper cell immunity than natural infection.,"immunization with subunit human immunodeficiency virus vaccine generates stronger t helper cell immunity than natural infection.. Healthy, human immunodeficiency virus seronegative (HIV-) volunteers were multiply immunized with a recombinant gp160 (rgp160) candidate acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) vaccine. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from volunteers immunized with 40 micrograms or with 80 micrograms (two volunteers per group) of rgp160, as well as from control donors, were tested for T helper (Th) cell function either prior to immunization, 8 to 12 months after the third immunization, or 2 to 5 months after the fourth immunization. The Th cell functional tests included antigen-induced in vitro interleukin 2 (IL 2) production and proliferation in response to influenza A virus (FLU) and to four synthetic peptides of HIV gp120 and gp160, previously demonstrated to be recognized by T cells from HIV naturally infected patients. Our results demonstrate the following: (a) immunization of HIV- individuals with rgp160 results in IL 2 production and T cell proliferation in response to HIV determinants; (b) boosting with rgp160 enhances Th function; (c) HIV-specific Th function is up to 100-fold greater in the multiply immunized volunteers than that observed in asymptomatic, HIV-infected individuals; and (d) multiple immunization with rgp160 does not impair Th function to a non-HIV antigen such as influenza A virus. These results indicate that immunization of uninfected individuals with an HIV subunit vaccine results in much stronger Th cell immunity than does natural infection and suggests that vaccination against HIV may be possible.",1991
s32882,human papillomavirus type 16 nucleoprotein e7 is a tumor rejection antigen.,"human papillomavirus type 16 nucleoprotein e7 is a tumor rejection antigen.. It has been speculated that immunological mechanisms play an important role in the control of carcinomas associated with human papillomavirus (HPV), such as cervical cancers. We have now demonstrated that immunization of C3H/HeN mice by syngeneic nontumorigenic fibroblast-like cells that contain the transfected HPV-16 E7 gene conferred protection against transplanted cells from a HPV-16 E7-positive syngeneic tumor. This protection was HPV-16 E7-specific and was mediated by CD8+ lymphocytes, which presumably were cytotoxic T lymphocytes. These results indicate that tumor cells containing HPV-16 E7, either as a result of transfection, as in our studies, or naturally, as occurs in many human carcinomas, can induce a tumor-specific rejection response and serve as targets for such a response. The system described here provides an animal model to further study immune responses to HPV-associated malignancies and to test the efficacy of anti-HPV vaccines toward the therapy and prevention of such tumors.",1991
s32986,a maternally inherited superantigen encoded by a mammary tumour virus.,"a maternally inherited superantigen encoded by a mammary tumour virus.. A collection of superantigens, molecules which in combination with class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) engage T cells bearing particular V beta chains as part of their alpha beta receptors, have recently been described. The mouse self superantigen, Mls-1a, for example, in conjunction with many MHC class II proteins, engages mouse T cells bearing V beta 6, 7, 8.1 and 9, almost regardless of the sequences of the other variable components of the receptors on the T cells. Two types of superantigen have been identified so far: first, superantigens encoded in the mouse genome, such as Mls-1a; second, superantigens produced by bacteria, such as the staphylococcal enterotoxins. Although the latter type of superantigens are in many cases known to be proteins of about 220 amino acids, nothing is known about the structures of any of the superantigens encoded in mouse. Here we describe the properties of a new mouse superantigen. The antigen is maternally transmitted in milk and is probably encoded by a mammary tumour virus (MTV). Given the known genetic linkage between at least one of the mouse genomic superantigens and endogenous MTV integration sites, it is tempting to speculate that the superantigen described here and some of the endogenous mouse superantigens are encoded by MTVs.",1991
s33024,expression of hepatitis b virus surface antigen in adult rat liver. co-introduction of dna and nuclear protein by a simplified liposome method.,"expression of hepatitis b virus surface antigen in adult rat liver. co-introduction of dna and nuclear protein by a simplified liposome method.. We established a simple and efficient method for gene transfer in vitro (to cultured cells) and in vivo (to an adult organ) using liposomes. Plasmid DNA and proteins were efficiently co-encapsulated in liposomes by agitation and sonication, and were co-introduced into cells by hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ)-mediated membrane fusion. Introduction of the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase gene with non-histone chromosomal protein high mobility group 1 (HMG1) into LLCMK2 cells resulted in about 3 times higher beta-galactosidase activity than that on introduction of the gene alone. Two days after injection of HVJ-liposomes containing the beta-galactosidase gene and HMG1 under the perisplanchnic membrane of adult rat liver, hepatic cells near the injection site were found by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl beta-D-galactoside staining to have beta-galactosidase activity. After similar injection of HVJ-liposomes containing the hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) gene and HMG1, HBsAg was detected in the serum for 9 days with a maximum of 25-45 ng/ml on day 2 after the injection.",1991
s33040,identification of two determinants that attenuate vaccine-related type 2 poliovirus.,"identification of two determinants that attenuate vaccine-related type 2 poliovirus.. The poliovirus P2/P712 strain is an attenuated virus that is closely related to the type 2 Sabin vaccine strain. By using a mouse model for poliomyelitis, sequences responsible for attenuation of the P2/P712 strain were previously mapped to the 5' noncoding region of the genome and a central region encoding VP1, 2Apro, 2B, and part of 2C. To identify specific determinants that attenuate the P2/P712 strain, recombinants between this virus and the mouse-adapted P2/Lansing were constructed and their neurovirulence in mice was determined. By using this approach, the attenuation determinant in the central region was mapped to capsid protein VP1. Candidate attenuating sequences in VP1 and the 5' noncoding region were identified by comparing the P2/P712 sequence with that of vaccine-associated isolate P2/P117, and the P2/117 sequences were introduced into the P2/Lansing-P2/P712 recombinants by site-directed mutagenesis. Results of neurovirulence assays in mice indicate that an A at nucleotide 481 in the 5' noncoding region and isoleucine (Ile) at position 143 of capsid protein VP1 are the major determinants of attenuation of P2/P712. These determinants also attenuated neurovirulence in transgenic mice expressing human poliovirus receptors, a new model for poliomyelitis in which virulent viruses are not host restricted. These results demonstrate that A-481 and Ile-143 are general determinants of attenuation.",1991
s33077,binding of the b cell activation antigen b7 to cd28 costimulates t cell proliferation and interleukin 2 mrna accumulation.,"binding of the b cell activation antigen b7 to cd28 costimulates t cell proliferation and interleukin 2 mrna accumulation.. A successful immune response requires intercellular contact between T and B lymphocytes. We recently showed that CD28, a T cell surface protein that regulates an activation pathway, could mediate intercellular adhesion with activated B cells by interaction with the B7 antigen. Here we show that CD28 is the primary receptor for B7 on activated peripheral blood T cells, that CD28 binds to B7 in the absence of other accessory molecules, and that interaction between CD28 and B7 is costimulatory for T cell activation. To characterize the binding of CD28 to B7, we have produced genetic fusions of the extracellular portions of B7 and CD28, and immunoglobulin (Ig) C gamma 1 chains. 125I-labeled B7 Ig bound to CD28-transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and to immobilized CD28 Ig with a Kd approximately 200 nM. B7 Ig also inhibited CD28-mediated cellular adhesion. The function of CD28-B7 interactions during T cell activation was investigated with soluble fusion proteins and with B7-transfected CHO cells. Immobilized B7 Ig and B7+ CHO cells costimulated T cell proliferation. Stimulation of T cells with B7+ CHO cells also specifically increased levels of interleukin 2 transcripts. These results demonstrate that the CD28 signaling pathway could be activated by B7, resulting in increased T cell cytokine production and T cell proliferation. Cellular interactions mediated by B7 and CD28 may represent an important component of the functional interactions between T and B lymphoid cells.",1991
s33131,molecular diagnosis of cutaneous t-cell lymphoma: polymerase chain reaction amplification of t-cell antigen receptor beta-chain gene rearrangements.,"molecular diagnosis of cutaneous t-cell lymphoma: polymerase chain reaction amplification of t-cell antigen receptor beta-chain gene rearrangements.. The goal of our study was to molecularly diagnose CTCL, by cloning the T-cell antigen receptor beta chain (TCR-beta) gene rearrangement from the malignant T cells of a patient with Sezary syndrome, in order to generate a specific oligonucleotide probe capable of detecting CTCL cells through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Total RNA isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes was reverse transcribed and resultant first strand cDNA was PCR amplified utilizing a concensus primer to the TCR-beta variable region (V beta) and a 3' primer to the TCR-beta constant region (C beta). PCR reaction products were subcloned into a plasmid vector and sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed that the patient's in-frame TCR-beta gene rearrangement utilized V beta 6.4, D beta 1.1, J beta 2.2, and C beta 2.1 gene segments. Oligo-primers to V beta 6.4 and J beta 2.2 were utilized to PCR amplify genomic DNA taken from the patient's blood and involved skin. Screening the amplified DNA with an oligo-probe specific for the patient's V-D-J junctional sequences resulted in the detection of the patient-specific sequences. No sequences were detected from DNA from other malignant or benign infiltrates.

s33631,the iga-binding beta antigen of the c protein complex of group b streptococci: sequence determination of its gene and detection of two binding regions.,"the iga-binding beta antigen of the c protein complex of group b streptococci: sequence determination of its gene and detection of two binding regions.. The beta antigen of the lbc protein complex of Group B streptococci is a cell-surface receptor which binds the Fc region of human immunoglobulin A (IgA). Determination of the nucleotide sequence of the beta antigen gene shows that it encodes a preprotein having a molecular weight of 130,963 daltons and a polypeptide of 1164 amino acid residues that is typical of other Gram-positive cell-wall proteins. There is a long signal sequence of 37 amino acids at the N-terminus. Four of the five C-terminal amino acid residues are basic and are preceded by a hydrophobic stretch that appears to anchor the C-terminus in the cell membrane. To the N-terminal side of this hydrophobic stretch is a putative cell-wall-spanning region containing proline-rich repeated sequences. An unusual feature of these repeated sequences is a three-residue periodicity, whereby every first residue is a proline, the second residue is alternating positively or negatively charged, and the third residue is uncharged. The IgA-binding activity was approximately localized by expressing subfragments of the beta antigen as fusion proteins. Two distinct but adjacent DNA segments specified peptides that bound IgA, which indicates that the IgA-binding activity is located in two distinct regions of the protein.",1991
s33707,a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing human carcinoembryonic antigen (cea).,"a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing human carcinoembryonic antigen (cea).. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a 180-kDa glycoprotein expressed on most gastrointestinal carcinomas. A 2.4-kb cDNA clone, containing the complete coding sequence, was isolated from a human colon tumor cell library and inserted into a vaccinia virus genome. This newly developed construct was characterized by Southern blotting, DNA hybridization studies, and polymerase chain reaction analysis. The CEA gene was stably integrated into the vaccinia virus thymidine kinase gene. The recombinant was efficiently replicated upon serial passages in cell cultures and in animals. The recombinant virus expresses on the surface of infected cells a protein product recognized by a monoclonal antibody (COL-I) directed against CEA. Immunization of mice with the vaccinia construct elicited a humoral immune response against CEA. Pilot studies also showed that administration of the recombinant CEA vaccinia construct was able to greatly reduce the growth in mice of a syngeneic murine colon adenocarcinoma which had been transduced with the human CEA gene. The use of this new recombinant CEA vaccinia construct may thus provide an approach in the specific active immunotherapy of human GI cancer and other CEA expressing carcinoma types.",1991
s33864,common west african hla antigens are associated with protection from severe malaria.,"common west african hla antigens are associated with protection from severe malaria.. A large case-control study of malaria in West African children shows that a human leucocyte class I antigen (HLA-Bw53) and an HLA class II haplotype (DRB1*1302-DQB1*0501), common in West Africans but rare in other racial groups, are independently associated with protection from severe malaria. In this population they account for as great a reduction in disease incidence as the sickle-cell haemoglobin variant. These data support the hypothesis that the extraordinary polymorphism of major histocompatibility complex genes has evolved primarily through natural selection by infectious pathogens.",1991
s34056,comparative safety and immunogenicity of yeast recombinant hepatitis b vaccines containing s and pre-s2 + s antigens.,"comparative safety and immunogenicity of yeast recombinant hepatitis b vaccines containing s and pre-s2 + s antigens.. One hundred and four healthy, hepatitis B virus (HBV) seronegative males were enrolled in a single blind, randomized pilot study to compare antibody and clinical responses to a yeast recombinant pre-S2 + S vaccine and a yeast recombinant S antigen vaccine (Recombivax HBR). Participants received either a 12, 24 or 48 micrograms dose of pre-S2 + S vaccine (with a 1:5 ratio by weight of pre-S2 and S antigens) or a 10 micrograms dose of Recombivax HBR by intramuscular injection at 0, 1 and 6 months; their serological and biochemical responses were measured at 0, 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 months, while their clinical responses were monitored for 5 days after each injection. The proportion of vaccines with minor local or systemic complaints (mainly sore arm, malaise, myalgia, fatigue) and the proportion developing antibody to surface antigen (anti-HBs) were similar for all vaccine groups. Transient elevations in alanine aminotransferase occurred infrequently. By 7 months almost all vaccinees developed anti-HBs, but titres were generally higher among recipients of pre-S2 + S vaccine. Antibody to pre-S2 antigen developed in 70-75% by 2 months and in 91-96% by 7 months. These data imply that the recombinant yeast pre-S2 + S vaccine is as well tolerated and as immunogenic as Recombivax HBR. Further studies are being conducted to assess antibody responses in larger numbers of healthy adults as well as in special populations with sub-optimal responses to currently licensed hepatitis B vaccines.",1991
s34131,presentation of viral antigen to class i major histocompatibility complex-restricted cytotoxic t lymphocyte. recognition of an immunodominant influenza hemagglutinin site by cytotoxic t lymphocyte is independent of the position of the site in the hemagglutinin translation product.,presentation of viral antigen to class i major histocompatibility complex-restricted cytotoxic t lymphocyte. recognition of an immunodominant influenza hemagglutinin site by cytotoxic t lymphocyte is independent of the position of the site in the hemagglutinin translation product.. Class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restricted T lymphocytes preferentially recognize fragments of polypeptides processed through a nonendosomal presentation pathway. At present the intracellular compartment(s) in which polypeptide fragmentation occurs and factors which influence the formation of an antigenic epitope are not well understood. To assess the role of residues flanking an antigenic site in the generation of the antigenic moiety recognized by class I MHC restricted T lymphocytes we have moved the coding sequence for an immunodominant H-2Kd restricted site on the influenza A/JAPAN/57 hemagglutinin (residues 202-221) by site-directed mutagenesis to six different positions along the coding sequence of the hemagglutinin gene. We have found that all six classes of mutants are recognized by MHC class I restricted T cells as efficiently as the wild type hemagglutinin gene product. Thus neither N-terminal to C-terminal position within the translation product nor sequences flanking the antigenic site influence processing.,1991
s34481,ompb (osmo-regulation) and icsa (cell-to-cell spread) mutants of shigella flexneri: vaccine candidates and probes to study the pathogenesis of shigellosis.,"ompb (osmo-regulation) and icsa (cell-to-cell spread) mutants of shigella flexneri: vaccine candidates and probes to study the pathogenesis of shigellosis.. Genetic and molecular data now available on the pathogenic properties of Shigella flexneri allow rational design of live attenuated vaccine strains. The genes required at given steps of the infection process can be selectively mutated to impair the bacterium's capacity to interact with intestinal epithelial cells and/or survive within intestinal tissues in general. We have tested two mutations in S. flexneri serotype 5a (M90T) which, alone or in combination, have yielded promising results when evaluated as vaccine prototypes in orally infected macaque monkeys. The first mutation, icsA, blocks intracellular and cell-to-cell spread of the micro-organism. This mutant (SC560) appeared reasonably well tolerated and elicited protection against homologous challenge. The second mutation, ompB, disconnects the bacterium from one of its major environmental regulatory factors, osmolarity. This mutant (SC433) still caused slight dysenteric symptoms in vaccinees. It was also perfectly protective. When these two mutations were combined, the double mutant (SC445), was perfectly tolerated but failed to protect one out of five animals. These studies bring interesting prospects of the possibility of immunizing against shigellosis. In addition to providing new possibilities for vaccine design, construction and evaluation of these mutants allowed substantial progress in understanding the pathogenesis of shigellosis.",1991
s34730,characterization of the attenuating m and np gene segments of the avian influenza a/mallard/78 virus during in vitro production of avian-human reassortant vaccine viruses and after replication in humans and primates.,"characterization of the attenuating m and np gene segments of the avian influenza a/mallard/78 virus during in vitro production of avian-human reassortant vaccine viruses and after replication in humans and primates.. A unique requirement for live attenuated reassortant influenza vaccines is the need to generate new reassortant vaccine viruses with the appearance of each new antigenic variant. Thus, the attenuation phenotype conferred by the attenuated donor influenza virus must remain genetically stable during the generation of each new reassortant vaccine virus. In this study we used nucleotide sequence analysis to evaluate the genetic stability of the attenuating M and NP genes of the avian influenza A/Mallard/NY/6750/78 attenuated donor virus during the in vitro generation and subsequent in vivo replication of avian-human (AH) influenza A reassortant vaccine viruses in monkeys and humans. Nucleotide sequence changes in the M and NP genes occurred at a rate of approximately 0.61 substitutions/1000 nt/reassortant during in vitro generation of four AH reassortant viruses. Only two nucleotide sequence changes occurred in the M and NP gene segments of four isolates of H1N1 or H3N2 AH vaccine viruses following 6-8 days of replication in seronegative children, and neither change affected amino acids previously identified as playing a potential role in attenuation. In addition, there were no changes in the nucleotide sequence of the M and NP genes of single gene AH reassortant viruses following five serial passages in squirrel monkeys. Finally, there was no change in the level or duration of replication of the single gene reassortant viruses in the upper or lower respiratory tract of monkeys following serial passage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1991
s34772,lack of hla class i antigen expression by cultured melanoma cells fo-1 due to a defect in b2m gene expression.,"lack of hla class i antigen expression by cultured melanoma cells fo-1 due to a defect in b2m gene expression.. The melanoma cell line FO-1 does not express HLA class I antigens and does not acquire them on the cell surface after incubation with IFN-gamma. Immunochemical studies showed that FO-1 cells synthesize HLA class I heavy chain, but do not synthesize beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-mu). The latter abnormality is associated with lack of beta 2-mu mRNA which remains undetectable in FO-1 cells incubated with IFN-gamma. The defect was identified as a genetic lesion in the B2m gene, since DNA hybridization analysis detected a deletion of the first exon of the 5'-flanking region, and of a segment of the first intron of the B2m gene. HLA class I antigen expression was reconstituted on melanoma cells FO-1 after transfection with the wild-type mouse B2m gene, thereby confirming the abnormality of the endogenous B2m gene. The defect identified in FO-1 cells is distinct from that underlying the lack of HLA class I antigen expression by lymphoblastoid cells Daudi, but is remarkably similar to that causing lack of H-2 class I antigen expression by mouse lymphoblastoid cells R1 (TL-). These results suggest that genetic recombination in the 5' region of the B2m gene is a recurrent mechanism in B2m gene defects. In addition to contributing to our understanding of molecular abnormalities in HLA class I antigen expression by melanoma cells, FO-1 cells represent a useful model for analyzing the role of HLA class I antigens in the biology of melanoma cells and in their interaction with cells of the immune system.",1991
s34797,human immune response to mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens.,"human immune response to mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens.. Little is known about the immunodominant or protective antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in humans. Cell-mediated immunity is necessary for protection, and healthy tuberculin-positive individuals are relatively resistant to exogenous reinfection. We compared the targets of the cell-mediated immune response in healthy tuberculin-positive individuals to those of tuberculosis patients and tuberculin-negative persons. By using T-cell Western blotting (immunoblotting) of nitrocellulose-bound M. tuberculosis culture filtrate, peaks of T-cell blastogenic activity were identified in the healthy tuberculin reactors at 30, 37, 44, 57, 64, 71 and 88 kDa. Three of these fractions (30, 64, and 71 kDa) coincided with previously characterized proteins: antigen 6/alpha antigen, HSP60, and HSP70, respectively. The blastogenic responses to purified M. tuberculosis antigen 6/alpha antigen and BCG HSP60 were assessed. When cultured with purified antigen 6/alpha antigen, lymphocytes of healthy tuberculin reactors demonstrated greater [3H]thymidine incorporation than either healthy tuberculin-negative controls or tuberculous patients (8,113 +/- 1,939 delta cpm versus 645 +/- 425 delta cpm and 1,019 +/- 710 delta cpm, respectively; P less than 0.01). Healthy reactors also responded to HSP60, although to a lesser degree than antigen 6/alpha antigen (4,276 +/- 1,095 delta cpm; P less than 0.05). Partially purified HSP70 bound to nitrocellulose paper elicited a significant lymphocyte blastogenic response in two of six of the tuberculous patients but in none of the eight healthy tuberculin reactors. Lymphocytes of none of five tuberculin-negative controls responded to recombinant antigens at 14 or 19 kDa or to HSP70. Antibody reactivity generally was inversely correlated with blastogenic response: tuberculous sera had high titer antibody to M. tuberculosis culture filtrate in a range from 35 to 180 kDa. This is the first systematic evaluation of the human response to a panel of native and recombinant antigens in healthy tuberculin reactors and tuberculous patients. Antigens which stimulated prominent lymphocyte blastogenic responses were identified in seven fractions on T-cell Western blot analysis. Two of these may represent previously characterized proteins; the others may contain immunodominant proteins that will require further characterization.",1991
s35073,immune response to hiv-1 gag antigens induced by recombinant adenovirus vectors in mice and rhesus macaque monkeys.,"immune response to hiv-1 gag antigens induced by recombinant adenovirus vectors in mice and rhesus macaque monkeys.. Recombinant adenovirus vectors expressing the entire gag (p55) or CA (p24) region of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were constructed by inserting the appropriate HIV DNA sequences into the E3 region of human adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) with and without an exogenous SV40 early promoter. The infectious recombinant adenoviruses Adgag1, AdSVgag1, and AdSVCA1 were shown to express the appropriate HIV-1 antigens in human cells in vitro, as measured by immunoprecipitation and p24 antigen capture assays. Using the p24 antigen capture assay, HIV antigen expressed by AdSVCA1 was detected earlier in infection and in greater amounts than that produced by either Adgag1 or AdSVgag1. In studies concerning the immunogenicity of these vectors, Balb/c (H-2d) mice given a single intraperitoneal injection of 10(7) or 10(8) plaque-forming units of purified vector developed serum antibodies to p24, detected by Western blotting, by 2 weeks postinjection. In the preliminary test of the immunogenicity of the recombinant adenovirus vectors in primates, two of four rhesus macaque monkeys generated antibodies to HIV-1 p24 following two injections of AdSVCA1. As expected, monkeys injected with control adenovirus failed to show any anti-HIV response, and none of the monkeys showed any adverse reactions following infection with either recombinant or control adenoviruses. These results suggest that adenovirus vectors have considerable potential in the study of possible immune therapies for HIV infection.",1991
s35118,the gene coding for a major tumor rejection antigen of tumor p815 is identical to the normal gene of syngeneic dba/2 mice.,"the gene coding for a major tumor rejection antigen of tumor p815 is identical to the normal gene of syngeneic dba/2 mice.. We showed previously that mouse mastocytoma P815 expresses several distinct antigens that are recognized by cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) of syngeneic DBA/2 mice. Antigens P815A and P815B are usually lost jointly and are targets for immune rejection responses in vivo. We used a cosmid library and a CTL stimulation assay to obtain transfectants expressing tumor rejection antigen P815A. From these transfectants we retrieved gene P1A which transferred the expression of both P815A and B. This gene is unrelated to three previously isolated genes coding for tum-antigens. It encodes a putative protein of 224 amino acids which contains two highly acidic domains showing homology with similar regions of nuclear proteins. The P1A gene expressed by tumor P815 is completely identical to the gene present in normal DBA/2 cells. Expression of the gene was tested by Northern blots. Cells from liver, spleen, and a number of mast cell lines were negative, but mast cell line L138.8A produced a high level of P1A message and was lysed by CTL directed against antigens P815A and B. We conclude that major tumor rejection antigens of P815 are encoded by a gene showing little or no expression in most normal cells of adult mice.",1991
s35147,protection against anthrax with recombinant virus-expressed protective antigen in experimental animals.,"protection against anthrax with recombinant virus-expressed protective antigen in experimental animals.. We previously described the cloning and expression of the protective antigen (PA) gene of Bacillus anthracis in both vaccinia virus and a baculovirus. The antigenicity of the PA products was characterized. PA expressed by the recombinant vaccinia viruses elicited a partial protective immune response against a lethal B. anthracis spore challenge in guinea pigs and mice. The WR strain vaccinia virus recombinant (WR-PA) protected 60% of male mice and 50% of guinea pigs. WR-PA elicited high anti-PA antibody titers in mice but not in guinea pigs. Connaught strain vaccinia virus recombinants failed to protect any immunized animals. PA purified from baculovirus recombinant-infected cultures plus adjuvant partially protected male CBA/J mice and completely protected female Hartley guinea pigs from challenge. Both the recombinant and nonrecombinant PA preparations combined with adjuvant elicited high anti-PA antibody titers in Hartley guinea pigs and CBA/J mice. These data demonstrate that the recombinant baculovirus- and vaccinia virus-produced PAs were immunogenic in both guinea pigs and mice, that the baculovirus-PA recombinant was a useful source of immunogenic PA, and that vaccinia virus-PA recombinants may be feasible live anthrax vaccine candidates worthy of consideration for further development as live vaccines.",1991
s35178,"genetic analysis of superoxide dismutase, the 23 kilodalton antigen of mycobacterium tuberculosis.","genetic analysis of superoxide dismutase, the 23 kilodalton antigen of mycobacterium tuberculosis.. The gene encoding a 23 kilodalton protein antigen has been cloned from Mycobacterium tuberculosis by screening of a recombinant DNA library with monoclonal antibodies. The product of the gene has been identified as the superoxide dismutase (SOD) of M. tuberculosis on the basis of sequence comparison and by expression of the recombinant protein in a functionally active form. The derived amino acid sequence of M. tuberculosis SOD reveals a close similarity to manganese-containing SODs from other organisms, in spite of the fact that previous studies using the purified enzyme have identified iron as the preferred metal ion ligand. SOD is present in the extracellular fluid of logarithmic-phase cultures of M. tuberculosis, but the structural gene is not preceded by a signal peptide sequence. Insertion of the M. tuberculosis SOD gene into a novel shuttle vector demonstrated the mycobacteria but is ineffective in Escherichia coli.",1991
s35275,"entry of l. monocytogenes into cells is mediated by internalin, a repeat protein reminiscent of surface antigens from gram-positive cocci.","entry of l. monocytogenes into cells is mediated by internalin, a repeat protein reminiscent of surface antigens from gram-positive cocci.. We report the identification of a previously unknown gene, inlA, which is necessary for the gram-positive intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes to invade cultured epithelial cells. The inlA region was localized by transposon mutagenesis, cloned, and sequenced. inlA was introduced into Listeria innocua and shown to confer on this normally noninvasive species the ability to enter cells. Sequencing of inlA predicts an 80 kd protein, internalin. Two-thirds of internalin is made up of two regions of repeats, region A and region B, and the C-terminus of the molecule is similar to that of surface proteins from gram-positive cocci. Internalin has a high content of threonine and serine residues, and the repeat motif of region A has regularly spaced leucine residues. As evidenced by Southern blot analysis, inlA is part of a gene family. One of them is the gene situated directly downstream of inlA, called inlB, which also encodes a leucine-rich repeat protein.",1991
s35368,role of b cell antigen processing and presentation in the humoral immune response.,"role of b cell antigen processing and presentation in the humoral immune response.. In the 25 years since it was first indicated that lymphocyte subpopulations must interact during the generation of a humoral immune response, there has been an explosion of data on the molecular mechanism of this interaction. It has been demonstrated that T cells recognize a processed antigen fragment presented by a major histocompatibility complex molecule on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell. The minimal peptides required for T cell recognition of several proteins have been determined, the molecular genetics of many of the cell surface molecules involved have been defined, and the three-dimensional structure of the T cell receptor and the major histocompatibility antigens have been deduced. Several cell types have been found to act as antigen-presenting cells, although the roles of these populations in vivo remain unclear. However, it is clear that there must be a physical interaction between a B cell and a T cell before the B cell can respond to a T-dependent antigen. This interaction requires processing and presentation of the antigen by the B cell. Therefore this review focuses on antigen processing and presentation by resting B cells, one of the key steps in initiation of a humoral immune response.",1991
s35635,efficient processing of an antigenic sequence for presentation by mhc class i molecules depends on its neighboring residues in the protein.,"efficient processing of an antigenic sequence for presentation by mhc class i molecules depends on its neighboring residues in the protein.. Processing of endogenously synthesized proteins generates short peptides that are presented by MHC class I molecules to CD8 T lymphocytes. Here it is documented that not only the sequence of the presented peptide but also the residues by which it is flanked in the protein determine the efficiency of processing and presentation. This became evident when a viral sequence of proven antigenicity was inserted at different positions into an unrelated carrier protein. Not different peptides, but different amounts of the antigenic insert itself were retrieved by isolation of naturally processed peptides from cells expressing the different chimeric proteins. Low yield of antigenic peptide from an unfavorable integration site could be overcome by flanking the insert with oligo-alanine to space it from disruptive neighboring sequences. Notably, the degree of protection against lethal virus disease related directly to the amount of naturally processed antigenic peptide.",1991
s35852,abrogation of tumorigenicity by mhc class ii antigen expression requires the cytoplasmic domain of the class ii molecule.,"abrogation of tumorigenicity by mhc class ii antigen expression requires the cytoplasmic domain of the class ii molecule.. Transfection of syngeneic MHC class II genes into the lethal mouse SaI tumor abrogates the malignancy of the tumor in the autologous host, and protects the host against subsequent challenges with the wild type class II- tumor. We have hypothesized that the transfectants induce protective immunity by functioning as APC for tumor peptides, and stimulating tumor-specific Th cells. Recent in vitro studies suggest that Ag presentation by class II-restricted APC requires the cytoplasmic domain of the class II molecule, and may involve intracellular signaling via the cytoplasmic domain. To determine if the class II cytoplasmic domain is required for enhanced tumor-specific immunity, SaI mouse sarcoma cells were transfected with syngeneic Aak and Abk genes with truncated cytoplasmic domains. These transfectants are as malignant as wild type class II- SaI cells in autologous A/J mice. Stimulation of tumor-specific immunity by class II+ tumor cells is therefore dependent on the class II cytoplasmic region, and may involve intracellular signaling events.",1991
s36069,monoclonal antibody-targeted superantigens: a different class of anti-tumor agents.,"monoclonal antibody-targeted superantigens: a different class of anti-tumor agents.. The bacterial superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) A (SEA) directs cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) expressing particular sequences of the T-cell receptor (TCR) beta chain to lyse tumor cells expressing major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, which serve as receptors for SEs. We now report that chemical conjugates of SEA and the colon carcinoma-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) C215 or C242 mediate T cell-dependent destruction of colon carcinoma cells lacking MHC class II molecules. SEA was covalently linked to the mAbs C215 and C242 via a PEG-based hydrophilic spacer. The C215-SEA conjugate targeted CD4+ as well as CD8+ CTLs to lyse a panel of colon carcinoma cells lacking MHC class II molecules. T-cell recognition of mAb-SEA conjugates was SEA specific, since SEB-selective T-cell lines with potent cytotoxic activity towards Raji cells coated with SEB did not respond to the C215-SEA conjugate. Unconjugated SEA did not induce T-cell lysis of MHC class II- colon carcinoma cells but efficiently directed CTLs against MHC class II+ Raji cells and certain interferon-treated MHC class II+ colon carcinoma cells. These results suggest that SEA-mAb conjugates retain the SEA-related selectivity for certain TCR beta-chain variable region (V beta) sequences but, in contrast to unconjugated SEA, mediate the TCR interaction in a MHC class II-independent manner. The cytotoxic activity mediated by C215-SEA and C242-SEA conjugates was blocked by excess of C215 mAb and C242 mAb, respectively, showing that the specificity in the targeting of mAb-SEA conjugates is defined by the antigen reactivity of the mAb. These results demonstrate that bacterial superantigens may be successfully conjugated to mAb with preserved T cell-activating capacity. The circumvention of MHC class II binding of SEs by conjugation to mAb suggests that such conjugates may find general application as antitumor agents, taking advantage of the extreme T cell-activating potency of superantigens.",1991
s36538,bacterial expression and secretion of various single-chain fv genes encoding proteins specific for a salmonella serotype b o-antigen.,"bacterial expression and secretion of various single-chain fv genes encoding proteins specific for a salmonella serotype b o-antigen.. Active single-chain Fv molecules encoded by synthetic genes have been expressed and secreted to the periplasm of Escherichia coli using the ompA secretory signal. Four different constructs were developed to investigate the effects of peptide linker design and VL-VH orientation on expression, secretion, and binding to a Salmonella O-polysaccharide antigen. Peptide linker sequences derived from the elbow regions of the Fab molecule were used alone or in combination with the flexible (GGGGS)2 sequence. VL and VH domain order in the single chain molecules had a profound effect on the level of secretion but hardly influenced total expression levels, which were approximately 50 mg/liter, chiefly in the form of inclusion bodies. With VL in the NH2-terminal position, the amount of secreted product obtained was 2.4 mg/liter, but when VH occupied this position the yield was less than 5% of this value. Enzyme immunoassays of the four products showed domain order and linker sequence affected antigen binding by less than an order of magnitude. Attempts to express active Fv from dicistronic DNA were unsuccessful, but active Fv was obtained from single-chain Fv by enzymic cleavage at a site in the elbow linker peptide. The thermodynamic binding parameters of intact and cleaved single-chain Fvs determined by titration microcalorimetry were similar to those of bacterially produced Fab and mouse IgG.",1991
s36579,protection of mice from fatal toxoplasma gondii infection by immunization with p30 antigen in liposomes.,"protection of mice from fatal toxoplasma gondii infection by immunization with p30 antigen in liposomes.. Using liposomes as adjuvant, a purified membrane Ag from Toxoplasma gondii (p30) has been tested for its protective effect in mice. Immunization with p30 in liposomes resulted in only one in 15 mice dying from a challenge that killed 11 of 15 control mice (receiving only buffer or liposomes without p30). The p30 Ag alone gave intermediate levels of protection, with 5 of 15 animals dying. The source of the p30 Ag was the rapidly growing, laboratory-adapted strain of T. gondii, RH; challenge was with the recently isolated C strain which still has all the properties of a wild-type strain. To assess the validity of this combination, the amino acid sequence of p30 from these two strains (as predicted from the corresponding gene sequence) was compared and found to differ in only eight residues. This minimal variation argued that RH was a valid source of material for a subunit vaccine, as subsequently confirmed by the protection studies. These results indicate that p30 is an appropriate Ag for development into a subunit vaccine for immunization of humans and/or domestic livestock, which are a major source of human infection.",1991
s36605,carcinoembryonic antigen gene family: molecular biology and clinical perspectives.,"carcinoembryonic antigen gene family: molecular biology and clinical perspectives.. The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene family belongs to the immunoglobulin super-gene family and can be divided into two main subgroups based on sequence comparisons. In humans it is clustered on the long arm of chromosome 19 and consists of approximately 20 genes. The CEA subgroup genes code for CEA and its classical crossreacting antigens, which are mainly membrane-bound, whereas the other subgroup genes encode the pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSG), which are secreted. Splice variants of individual genes and differential post-translational modifications of the resulting proteins, e.g., by glycosylation, indicate a high complexity in the number of putative CEA-related molecules. So far, only a limited number of CEA-related antigens in humans have been unequivocally assigned to a specific gene. Rodent CEA-related genes reveal a high sequence divergence and, in part, a completely different domain organization than the human CEA gene family, making it difficult to determine individual gene counterparts. However, rodent CEA-related genes can be assigned to human subgroups based on similarity of expression patterns, which is characteristic for the subgroups. Various functions have been determined for members of the CEA subgroup in vitro, including cell adhesion, bacterial binding, an accessory role for collagen binding or ecto-ATPases activity. Based on all that is known so far on its biology, the clinical outlook for the CEA family has been reassessed.",1991
s36620,rapid antigenic-type replacement and dna sequence evolution of canine parvovirus.,"rapid antigenic-type replacement and dna sequence evolution of canine parvovirus.. Analysis of canine parvovirus (CPV) isolates with a panel of monoclonal antibodies showed that after 1986, most viruses isolated from dogs in many parts of the United States differed antigenically from the viruses isolated prior to that date. The new antigenic type (designated CPV type 2b) has largely replaced the previous antigenic type (CPV type 2a) among virus isolates from the United States. This represents the second occurrence of a new antigenic type of this DNA virus since its emergence in 1978, as the original CPV type (CPV type 2) had previously been replaced between 1979 and 1981 by the CPV type 2a strain. DNA sequence comparisons showed that CPV types 2b and 2a differed by as few as two nonsynonymous (amino acid-changing) nucleotide substitutions in the VP-1 and VP-2 capsid protein genes. One mutation, resulting in an Asn-Asp difference at residue 426 in the VP-2 sequence, was shown by comparison with a neutralization-escape mutant selected with a non-CPV type 2b-reactive monoclonal antibody to determine the antigenic change. The mutation selected by that monoclonal antibody, a His-Tyr difference in VP-2 amino acid 222, was immediately adjacent to residue 426 in the three-dimensional structure of the CPV capsid. The CPV type 2b isolates are phylogenetically closely related to the CPV type 2a isolates and are probably derived from a common ancestor. Phylogenetic analysis showed a progressive evolution away from the original CPV type. This pattern of viral evolution appears most similar to that seen in some influenza A viruses.",1991
s36691,elimination from peripheral lymphoid tissues of self-reactive b lymphocytes recognizing membrane-bound antigens.,"elimination from peripheral lymphoid tissues of self-reactive b lymphocytes recognizing membrane-bound antigens.. The long-standing hypothesis that tolerance to self antigens is mediated by either elimination or functional inactivation (anergy) or self-reactive lymphocytes is now accepted, but little is known about the factors responsible for initiating one process rather than the other. In the B-cell lineage, tolerant self-reactive cells persist in the peripheral lymphoid organs of transgenic mice expressing lysozyme and anti-lysozyme immunoglobulin genes, but are eliminated in similar transgenic mice expressing anti-major histocompatibility complex immunoglobulin genes. By modifying the structure of the lysozyme transgene and the isotype of the anti-lysozyme immunoglobulin genes, we demonstrate here that induction of anergy or deletion is not due to differences in antibody affinity or isotype, but to recognition of monomeric or oligomeric soluble antigen versus highly multivalent membrane-bound antigen. Our findings indicate that the degree of receptor crosslinking can have qualitatively distinct signalling consequences for lymphocyte development.",1991
s37223,stabilization of recombinant avirulent vaccine strains in vivo.,"stabilization of recombinant avirulent vaccine strains in vivo.. Salmonella strains attenuated by various mutational alterations and expressing heterologous colonization and virulence antigens specified by cloned genes have begun to be widely used as vaccines for oral immunization to induce protective immunity against the pathogens supplying the genes for the colonization or virulence antigens. Problems associated with plasmid instability and/or poor expression of cloned gene products have frequently been encountered and regulatory agencies are now banning use of antibiotic resistance markers in live attenuated vaccine strains. We have therefore developed a balanced lethal host-vector system in which the chromosome of the attenuated vaccine strain contains a deletion mutation that impose a requirement for diaminopimelic acid (DAP), an essential constituent of the rigid layer of the cell wall of all Gram-negative and some Gram-positive microbes. The plasmid cloning vector contains the wild-type allele for this gene allowing the recombinant avirulent Salmonella to be independent of DAP. Since DAP is not prevalent in nature, especially in the animal host, essentially 100% of the surviving avirulent Salmonella recovered from an immunized animal host still contain the recombinant plasmid and express the foreign colonization or virulence antigen. Occasional loss of the plasmid renders the avirulent Salmonella DAP-requiring, which quickly results in DAPless death with lysis of the bacterium to release its antigenic contents, an occurrence which might further enhance the immune response to the foreign colonization or virulence antigen. We describe below strains of bacteria, recombinant vectors and the methods to make use of this system in a diversity of situations for development of live recombinant avirulent vaccines as well as for other potential applications.",1990
s37748,"stable, high-level expression of a carcinoembryonic antigen-encoding cdna after transfection and amplification with the dominant and selectable asparagine synthetase marker.","stable, high-level expression of a carcinoembryonic antigen-encoding cdna after transfection and amplification with the dominant and selectable asparagine synthetase marker.. The introduction and expression of cloned genes in a wide variety of animal cells requires the convenient use of dominant selectable markers. Very few of these markers can be amplified in copy number, a necessary feature if variable and high-level expression of the gene of interest is required. We describe the successful dominant transfection and amplification of a vector containing the Escherichia coli asparagine synthetase (AS)-encoding gene, asnA, transfected into a variety of human and rodent cell lines. An unlinked co-transfected expression vector containing the CEA cDNA, encoding human carcinoembryonic antigen, can be co-amplified with the asnA marker leading to extremely high levels of CEA synthesis. In addition, we show that the expression of both the asnA marker and the co-transfected CEA construct are stable in normal and amplified transfectants after prolonged culture in the absence of selective pressure.",1990
s37845,plasmid-encoded production of coli surface-associated antigen 1 (cs1) in a strain of escherichia coli serotype o139.h28.,"plasmid-encoded production of coli surface-associated antigen 1 (cs1) in a strain of escherichia coli serotype o139.h28.. Production of coli surface-associated antigen 1 (CS1) by Escherichia coli strain E24377 of serotype O139.H28 was controlled by a plasmid that also encoded heat stable and heat labile enterotoxins and CS3. The presence of a regulatory sequence was detected on this plasmid by hybridization with the cfaD gene that regulates expression of colonization factor antigen I fimbriae and is at least 96% homologous with the rns sequence controlling production of CS1 or CS2 fimbriae by strains of serotype O6.H16 of appropriate biotype. A separate plasmid, pDEP20, carrying the structural genes for CS1 synthesis was identified and transformed into E. coli strain HB101 or a derivative of strain E24377 without large plasmids. Transformants carrying pDEP20 did not produce CS1 fimbrial antigen, but antigen expression was obtained when a cloned cfaD gene or a wild-type plasmid carrying the rns sequence was introduced. Transposon mutagenesis with Tn1000 identified a 3.7 kbp region of pDEP20 essential for production of CS1 fimbriae. Genes encoding production of CS1 fimbriae were cloned on a 9.9 kbp BamHI fragment and were expressed in the presence of the cfaD sequence. A strain producing both CS1 and CS2 antigens was constructed by introduction of the cloned cfaD gene into a strain of serotype O6.H16 biotype C carrying plasmid pDEP20.",1990

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) recombinant envelope glycoprotein (rgp 160) candidate vaccine in humans. SUBJECTS: Healthy adults (72) who were seronegative for HIV-1 were randomly assigned to one of four groups. INTERVENTIONS: The subjects were randomly assigned to receive 40 or 80 micrograms of rgp 160, 10 micrograms of hepatitis B vaccine, or placebo in three doses (on days 0, 30, and 180), with an elective, nonblinded administration of a fourth dose on day 540. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Neither clinical nor laboratory toxicity was encountered during a follow-up period exceeding 21 months. No effect of immunization was noted on lymphocyte counts, mitogenic responses, or delayed-type hypersensitivity. Serum antibody responses to HIV envelope proteins detected by Western blot were seen in 30 of 33 subjects (91%; 95% CI, 71% to 97%) receiving either 40- or 80-micrograms doses of rgp160 and were most commonly of weakly reactive intensity. Responses were first noted by Western blot after the second dose. They markedly increased in frequency after the third dose and declined over the next 12 to 18 months. The administration of a fourth dose resulted in homologous neutralizing activity in sera from 5 to 24 subjects (21%; CI, 7% to 37%) as well as in complement-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement in sera from 6 of 24 subjects (25%; CI, 10% to 42%). Antibody responses were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) less frequently than by Western blot, and these responses persisted for a shorter time. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of rgp160 was well tolerated and safe, resulted in a high rate of antibody response by Western blot after the administration of the third and fourth doses, and generated serum neutralizing activity and complement-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement in some subjects after the fourth dose.",1991
s38267,structural and antigenic polymorphism of the 35- to 48-kilodalton merozoite surface antigen (msa-2) of the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum.,"structural and antigenic polymorphism of the 35- to 48-kilodalton merozoite surface antigen (msa-2) of the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum.. Merozoite surface antigen MSA-2 of the human parasite Plasmodium falciparum is being considered for the development of a malaria vaccine. The antigen is polymorphic, and specific monoclonal antibodies differentiate five serological variants of MSA-2 among 25 parasite isolates. The variants are grouped into two major serogroups, A and B. Genes encoding two different variants from serogroup A have been sequenced, and their DNA together with deduced amino acid sequences were compared with sequences encoded by other alleles. The comparison shows that the serological classification reflects differences in DNA sequences and deduced primary structure of MSA-2 variants and serogroups. Thus, the overall homologies of DNA and amino acid sequences are over 95% among variants in the same serogroup. In contrast, similarities between the group A variants and a group B variant are only 70 and 64% for DNA and amino acid sequences, respectively. We propose that the MSA-2 protein is encoded by two highly divergent groups of alleles, with limited additional polymorphism displayed within each group.",1991
s38432,molecular analysis of variant plasmid forms of a bivalent salmonella typhi-shigella sonnei vaccine strain.,"molecular analysis of variant plasmid forms of a bivalent salmonella typhi-shigella sonnei vaccine strain.. The Salmonella typhi-Shigella sonnei hybrid vaccine strain 5076-IC was constructed to express the S. sonnei form I antigen, which may play an important role in producing protective immunity. Three clonal variants which existed in preparations of the vaccine could be distinguished phenotypically by lactose utilization, S. sonnei form I antigen expression, and restriction enzyme analysis of large plasmid DNA. Since expression of the form I antigen was lost in two of the clonal variants, genetic instability of the 120-MDa vaccine plasmid appeared to be a potential problem. To examine the molecular basis of this genetic instability, we hybridized large plasmid DNA isolated from the clonal variants to a variety of DNA probes encoding virulence-associated antigens and to Escherichia coli lacZ DNA. Results indicated that DNA rearrangement accompanied by deletions of plasmid material occurred in the vaccine plasmid. In addition, the vaccine plasmid did not contain some S. sonnei genetic material encoding antigenic polypeptides necessary for virulence.",1991

Thirty-two clinical isolates of Shiga-like toxin (SLT)-producing Escherichia coli associated with single cases or outbreaks of bloody diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, the hemolytic uremic syndrome, or edema disease of swine were examined for multiple copies of genes belonging to the slt-I or slt-II toxin families. Five of 19 strains that were known to produce SLT-II or to hybridize to slt-II-specific probes by colony blot were found by Southern hybridization to contain two copies of toxin genes related to slt-II. The genes for two toxins closely related to slt-II were cloned from one of the isolates, Escherichia coli O157:H- strain E32511. One copy of the operon was found to be essentially identical to slt-II; it differed from slt-II by only one nucleotide base. This single nucleotide difference did not affect the predicted amino acid sequence. The predicted amino acid sequence of the A subunit of the second operon was identical to that of SLT-II, but the predicted amino acid sequence of the B subunit was identical to that of the B2F1 toxin VT2ha. We designated this second operon slt-IIc. Neutralization assays using several monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antiserum prepared against SLT-II showed that SLT-IIc was antigenically related to but distinct from SLT-II.",1991
s38714,rabies virus nucleoprotein expressed in and purified from insect cells is efficacious as a vaccine.,"rabies virus nucleoprotein expressed in and purified from insect cells is efficacious as a vaccine.. A cDNA copy of the RNA gene that encodes the nucleoprotein N of rabies virus Evelyn-Rokitnicki-Abelseth strain was cloned into baculovirus. The recombinant baculovirus expressed the N protein abundantly in Spodoptera frugiperda cells. The N protein was extracted from infected Spodoptera frugiperda cells and purified to near homogeneity by affinity chromatography. The purified N protein reacted with 31 of 32 monoclonal antibodies that recognize native rabies virus ribonucleoprotein. Like the ribonucleoprotein, the purified N protein was a major antigen capable of inducing virus-specific helper T cells. Priming of mice with the purified N protein prior to a booster inoculation with inactivated Evelyn-Rokitnicki-Abelseth virus vaccine resulted in a 20-fold increase in the production of virus-neutralizing antibodies. After immunization with the purified N protein, mice developed a strong anti-ribonucleoprotein antibody response and were protected against a lethal challenge of rabies virus. These data indicate that the N protein expressed in insect cells is antigenically and immunogenically comparable to the authentic rabies virus ribonucleoprotein and therefore represents a potential source of an effective and economical vaccine for large-scale immunization of humans and animals against rabies.",1991
s38885,a v region mutation in a phosphocholine-binding monoclonal antibody results in loss of antigen binding.,a v region mutation in a phosphocholine-binding monoclonal antibody results in loss of antigen binding.. A V region mutant producing an antibody that had lost the ability to bind phosphocholine was isolated from a hybridoma producing a germline encoded T15 antibody. The mutation resulted in a single aspartic acid to asparagine substitution at residue 95 of the H chain V region. This confirms that the aspartic acid at residue 95 plays a major role in Ag binding. The results also suggest that somatic cell genetic techniques can be used to generate mAb with useful changes in Ag binding.,1991

Live Shigella flexneri 2a vaccine candidate strains with deletion mutations in the aro genes were constructed. Tn10-generated auxotrophic mutations were transduced from Escherichia coli to S. flexneri 2a with bacteriophage P1CmCts. The tetracycline-sensitive derivatives of Tn10 mutants obtained were selected on Bochner's medium and checked by DNA-DNA hybridization using aroA and aroD gene specific probes. The vaccine candidate strains were tested to assess the efficacy of protection in guinea-pig conjunctival epithelia (Sereny test). The strains did not cause keratoconjunctivitis and exhibited significant protection in the challenge experiments. A candidate vaccine strain (delta aroD) showed 100% protection against 10(7) c.f.u. of wild type strain in the immunized guinea-pigs.,1991

A cold-adapted (ca) influenza B reassortant vaccine consisting of two genes encoding the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase from wild-type influenza B/Ann Arbor/1/86 virus and the six internal RNA segments from influenza B/Ann Arbor/1/66 ca virus was evaluated in 18 seropositive and 57 seronegative infants and children. The ca reassortant was infectious in seronegative vaccinees, with an estimated 50% human infectious dose of 10(2.5) TCID50. Nasal wash specimens from vaccinees retained the temperature-sensitive phenotype, indicating that the virus was phenotypically stable after replication in fully susceptible children. The vaccine was highly immunogenic in the seronegative vaccinees; 54% of the seropositive vaccinees also developed an increase in serum antibody. The ca vaccine was well tolerated, with only a mild increase in upper respiratory tract symptoms seen in the seronegative vaccinees. These studies indicate that the B/Ann Arbor/1/86 ca reassortant is safe, immunogenic, and phenotypically stable in infants and children.",1991

Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV)-induced rat T-cell lymphomas express discrete 1.8-, 2.2-, and 4-kb mRNA transcripts hybridizing under conditions of reduced stringency to a probe derived from a region upstream of the first exon of the Tpl-1/Ets-1 gene. Screening a cDNA library from one rat T-cell lymphoma with this genomic probe yielded 15 cDNA clones which were derived from 10 different genes. One of these genes, defined by the cDNA clone pRcT7a, was expressed as a 1.8-kb mRNA transcript in spleen and thymus but not in other normal rat tissues. Expression of the gene defined by the pRcT7a cDNA clone in a series of MoMuLV-induced rat T-cell lymphomas showed a perfect correlation with the expression of the rat leukocyte antigen MRC OX-44. Because of this observation, the pRcT7a clone was sequenced and it was shown to identify a gene coding for a 219-amino-acid protein. The homology between pRcT7a and the Tpl-1 probe used for its detection mapped within the 3' untranslated region of the pRcT7a cDNA clone. The pRcT7a protein, which exhibits four putative transmembrane regions and three putative glycosylation sites, contains a region which is nearly identical in sequence to a peptide derived from the rat leukocyte antigen MRC OX-44. This finding suggested that the pRcT7a cDNA clone defines the gene coding for OX-44. To confirm this finding, a pRcT7a construct in the retrovirus vector pZipNeo was introduced into the OX-44- T-cell lymphoma line 2788. Immunostaining with the MRC OX-44 monoclonal antibody followed by flow cytometry revealed that following gene transfer, the 2788 cells became OX-44+. Sequence comparisons revealed that pRcT7a/MRC OX-44 is a member of a family of genes which includes the melanoma-specific antigen ME491; the human leukocyte antigen CD37; the protein TAPA-1, which is expressed on the surface of human T cells and appears to be involved in growth regulation; the human gastrointestinal tumor antigen CO-029; and the Schistosoma mansoni-associated antigen Sm23.",1991

Characteristics of avian-human (ah) and cold-adapted (ca) influenza A/Kawasaki/9/86 (H1N1) reassortant vaccine viruses were compared in 37 seronegative adults and 122 seronegative infants and children. The 50% human infectious dose (HID50) in infants and children was 10(2.9) and 10(2.6) TCID50 for the ah and ca vaccine, respectively. The ah influenza A/Kawasaki/9/86 reassortant was reactogenic: 24% of infants and children infected with greater than or equal to 100 HID50 had fever greater than or equal to 39.4 degrees C. Since H3N2 ah vaccines were previously shown to be adequately attenuated, it is reasonable to suggest that the genes that code for hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of the H1N1 virus apparently influence the reactogenicity of reassortant viruses derived from the avian influenza A/Mallard/New York/6750/78 donor virus. Because this avian virus does not reproducibly confer a satisfactory level of attenuation to each subtype of influenza A virus, it is not a suitable donor virus for attenuation of wild-type influenza viruses. In contrast, the ca A/Ann Arbor/6/60 donor virus reliably confers attenuation characteristics to a variety of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A viruses.",1991
s39520,cloning of toxoplasma gondii gene fragments encoding diagnostic antigens.,"cloning of toxoplasma gondii gene fragments encoding diagnostic antigens.. Two Toxoplasma gondii gene fragments, which encode polypeptides that can be used as diagnostic antigens in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were cloned and their nucleotide sequence was determined. One of the fragments (derived from the H4 gene) is 682 bp long. The mRNA of the single-copy H4 gene is 1300 nt long. The fragment derived from the other gene, termed H11, is 197 bp long. The mRNA of the single-copy H11 gene is 1900 nt long. The native polypeptides encoded by the H4 and H11 genes are 25 and 41 kDa, respectively. Based on computer analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences of the polypeptides encoded by the gene fragments, both appear to be very hydrophilic and that encoded by the H11 fragment has a high antigenic index profile. These results are consistent with the diagnostic usefulness of the polypeptides encoded by the gene fragments.",1991
s39950,"two novel virulence loci, mxia and mxib, in shigella flexneri 2a facilitate excretion of invasion plasmid antigens.","two novel virulence loci, mxia and mxib, in shigella flexneri 2a facilitate excretion of invasion plasmid antigens.. A bank of over 4,200 lacZ protein fusions in Shigella flexneri 2a was screened for fusions to temperature-regulated promoters. One mutant, BS260, was completely noninvasive on HeLa cells and mapped to a region on the 220-kb virulence plasmid in which we had previously localized several avirulent temperature-regulated operon fusions (A.E. Hromockyj and A.T. Maurelli, Infect. Immun. 57:2963-2970, 1989). The phenotype of BS260 was similar to that of the previously identified mxi (membrane expression of invasion plasmid antigens) mutants, since it made wild-type intracellular levels of the invasion plasmid antigens (Ipa) but was deficient in the surface expression of IpaB and IpaC. Six kilobases of DNA upstream of the BS260 fusion end joint were cloned, but no temperature-regulated promoter was found, whereas the fusion end joint clone of the noninvasive mxi operon fusion mutant BS226 contained a temperature-regulated promoter. The locus defined by BS260 was designated mxiA, and that defined by BS226 was designated mxiB. Closer analysis of the mxiA and mxiB phenotypes by a cell-free enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that the mutants failed to excrete IpaB and IpaC into the culture medium, whereas wild-type cells actively released these antigens. Excretion of the ipa polypeptides from wild-type bacteria was confirmed by Western blot analysis of culture supernatants. Protease protection experiments revealed that wild-type S. flexneri 2a actually had much lower levels of surface-exposed IpaB and IpaC relative to those in the total antigen pool. In addition, examination of cellular fractions showed that, although there was no IpaB or IpaC in the outer membrane of BS260 and BS226, the antigens did accumulate in the cytoplasmic membrane. A 76-kDa temperature-regulated polypeptide in wild-type S. flexneri was identified as the putative mxiA gene product. These results strongly suggest that IpaB and IpaC represent truly excreted proteins of S. flexneri and that the mxiA and mxiB loci on the plasmid code for accessory proteins required to facilitate their export through the bacterial outer membrane. These data also suggest that mxiA is part of an operon that specifies additional mxi genes. The products of this operon may constitute a unique multicomponent protein secretion apparatus involved in the transport of Shigella virulence determinants.",1991
s40169,antibody responses to a synthetic peptide-based malaria vaccine candidate: influence of sequence variants of the peptide.,"antibody responses to a synthetic peptide-based malaria vaccine candidate: influence of sequence variants of the peptide.. A synthetic peptide (Asn-Ala-Asn-Pro)3, representing a protective sequence from the sporozoite stage of Plasmodium falciparum, conjugated to tetanus toxoid has undergone clinical testing. Although some protection was obtained, anti-parasite responses were generally low. In attempting to improve the anti-parasite protein antibody response, we evaluated the efficacy of tetanus toxoid conjugates containing seven sequence variants of the peptide. Most of the conjugates tested in both mice and monkeys elicited anti-peptide antibodies with fine specificity differences, although there was a broad degree of cross-reactivity. In general, each conjugate tested evoked similarly high anti-sporozoite antibody responses in both species and, thus, based on antibody titer no evidence for a superior vaccine candidate was obtained. The biological activity of one antiserum actually increased the penetration of sporozoites into human liver cells. In contrast, antisera against the other conjugates inhibited sporozoite penetration, but to a similar degree. Based on these two criteria, none of the other conjugates would appear to be better vaccine candidates than the original conjugate. The lack of concordance between anti-peptide or anti-sporozoite titers and inhibitory activity in the case of one antiserum indicates that these two measures of antibody cannot always be used for predicting anti-sporozoite activity.",1991
s40245,humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to live recombinant bcg-hiv vaccines.,"humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to live recombinant bcg-hiv vaccines.. Several viral and bacterial live recombinant vaccine vehicles are being developed to produce a new generation of vaccines against a broad spectrum of infectious diseases. The human tuberculosis vaccine Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) has features that make it a particularly attractive live recombinant vaccine vehicle. BCG and other mycobacteria are highly effective adjuvants, and the immune response to mycobacteria has been studied extensively. With nearly two billion immunizations, BCG has a long record of safe use in man. It is one of the few vaccines that can be given at birth, it engenders long-lived immune responses with only a single dose, and there is a worldwide distribution network with experience in BCG vaccination. Recently developed molecular genetic tools and methods for mycobacteria have provided the means to introduce foreign genes into BCG. Here we report that a variety of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 polypeptides can be expressed in BCG recombinants under the control of the mycobacterial hsp70 promoter and that the foreign polypeptides produced in BCG can induce antibody and T-cell responses. These results demonstrate that BCG can be used as a live recombinant vaccine vehicle to induce immune responses to pathogen proteins produced by the bacillus.",1991

As a research tool, recombinant vaccinia viruses are used to synthesize biologically active proteins and analyze structure-function relations, determine the targets of humoral- and cell-mediated immunity, and investigate the immune responses needed for protection against specific infectious diseases. When more data on safety and efficacy are available, recombinant vaccinia and related poxviruses may be candidates for live vaccines and for cancer immunotherapy.",1991
s40346,production of antigen-specific human monoclonal antibodies from in vitro-primed human splenocytes.,"production of antigen-specific human monoclonal antibodies from in vitro-primed human splenocytes.. We have developed culture conditions for human lymphocytes that support primary in vitro immune responses to protein Ag of either human or nonhuman origin. We now show that these primed B cells can be efficiently immortalized by fusion with a heterohybrid fusion partner to generate human, Ag-specific IgM or IgG antibody-producing heterohybridomas at a rate of 17 to 50 hybrids/10(6) lymphocytes fused. Approximately 50% of the Ig-secreting clones were stable with respect to Ig secretion. Levels of secretion attained with terminal cultures ranged from less than 1 to 100 micrograms/ml. Fusions of cells between 2 and 5 days after initiation of in vitro exposure to Ag produced more Ag-reactive and Ag-specific antibodies than fusions at 1 day or fusions performed after 5 days. Ag-reactive hybrids could be isolated at frequencies of 3 to 10%, depending on antigenicity of the immunogen. Foreign proteins, horse spleen ferritin, and a murine monoclonal Ig, induced higher percentages of Ag-reactive mAb than immunization with the human-derived ferritin. Ag-reactive IgG mAb were produced at relatively high frequency, depending on immunization conditions and the nature of the Ag. The strategy for identification of the best hybrids included early elimination of unstable hybridomas and of hybridomas producing broadly cross-reactive antibody, followed by evaluation of units of Ag reactivity/micrograms Ig. Ferritin-specific mAb selected according to these criteria showed immunocytochemical reactivity with ferritin-containing tissues and apparent affinities in the range of 10(7) to 10(8)/mol.",1991
s40399,expression of the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus nef protein in t cells prevents antigen receptor-mediated induction of interleukin 2 mrna.,"expression of the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus nef protein in t cells prevents antigen receptor-mediated induction of interleukin 2 mrna.. Stable transformants of the Jurkat T-cell line have been obtained that express either of two distinct forms of the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus nef gene: the nef-1-encoded protein (Nef-1) contains alanine, glycine, and valine at positions 15, 29, and 33, respectively; the protein specified by nef-2 (Nef-2) has threonine, arginine, and alanine at the corresponding positions. When Jurkat cells or their Nef-2-expressing transformants are treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) plus either phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or antibodies against CD3 epsilon, T-cell receptor beta chain, or CD2, there is a prompt increase in interleukin 2 (IL-2) mRNA and intracellular calcium and in the IL-2 receptor alpha chain on the cell surface. Although cells expressing Nef-1 also induce calcium mobilization and the production of IL-2 receptor alpha chain, the formation of IL-2 mRNA is blocked in response to these stimuli. Moreover, Nef-1-expressing cells transfected with a plasmid in which the IL-2 promoter is fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene fail to induce CAT following treatment with PMA and PHA. By contrast, the parental and Nef-2-containing cells induce CAT normally. Nef-1-expressing cells can produce IL-2 mRNA in response to a combination of PMA and ionomycin, although much less efficiently than the parental Jurkat cells or Nef-2-expressing cells. These findings, and others described herein, suggest that the virally encoded Nef protein interferes with a signal emanating from the T-cell receptor complex that induces IL-2 gene transcription.",1991
s40799,characterization and localization of plasmodium falciparum surface antigens on infected erythrocytes from west african patients.,"characterization and localization of plasmodium falciparum surface antigens on infected erythrocytes from west african patients.. The malaria-induced surface antigens on Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes from West African patients were characterized by agglutination of infected cells by human sera, surface immunofluorescence of live infected cells, inhibition of cytoadherence to C32 melanoma cells by human sera, immunoelectron microscopy (immunoEM), and immunoprecipitation. In a nonimmune individual, serum antibody reactivity to surface antigens of infected cells was acquired during convalescence, as tested by all five methods, and was generally parasite isolate-specific. By contrast, adult hyperimmune West African sera reacted with many isolates, including isolates from geographically distinct regions. A quantitative correlation was established between agglutination and surface immunofluorescence assay titers, and between surface immunofluorescence assay and immunoEM reactivity, suggesting that a single antigen or a set of coexpressed antigens is being detected. Surface iodination of infected cells identified trypsin-sensitive high M, antigens in the sodium dodecyl sulfate extract. All sera tested that agglutinated infected cells also immunoprecipitated these antigens. The same surface antigens were immunoprecipitated by the homologous convalescent serum as by adult sera. By immunoEM these antigens were localized exclusively at the knob-like protrusions of infected cells, where they may participate in adherence to vascular endothelium.",1991
s41118,cloning of the amino terminal nucleotides of the antigen i/ii of streptococcus sobrinus and the immune responses to the corresponding synthetic peptides.,"cloning of the amino terminal nucleotides of the antigen i/ii of streptococcus sobrinus and the immune responses to the corresponding synthetic peptides.. A portion of the antigen I/II (spaA, B, P1) gene of Streptococcus sobrinus 6715, containing the coding sequence for the amino terminal 684 amino acids of the protein, was cloned in bacteriophage lambda GT10. Selection was by immunological detection using a polyclonal antiserum to the antigen I/II from Strep. mutans. From the amino acid sequence, peptides were synthesized, 15 amino acids in length, that covered the entire sequence. In total, 260 synthetic peptides were synthesized and evaluated for their immunogenicity in Balb/C mice. Thirty-nine peptides were immunogenic, without carrier, and the antisera generated were tested for their ability to bind cells of Strep. mutans and Strep. sobrinus in a solid-phase assay. Antisera corresponding to peptides from five regions on the I/II molecule bound cells of both bacterial species. These peptides were then evaluated for their ability to stimulate in vitro murine lymphocyte proliferation, after in vivo immunization with Strep. sobrinus cells. Two of the peptides were capable of stimulating proliferation, as determined by incorporation of [3H]-thymidine into murine lymph node cells. The sequences of these 5 peptides were then compared to sequences found in the antigen I/II from Strep. mutans (Kelly et al., 1989). As expected, there was considerable homology between the cross-reactive peptides synthesized and the analogous region from Strep. mutans. This homology was not usually contiguous and suggests that the antibodies bind a face of antigen I/II that is in an alpha-helical conformation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1990

We have constructed a general-use vector for the cloning and stable expression of foreign genes in the chromosome of attenuated Salmonella typhimurium. Using this chromosomal expression vector (CEV), we expressed the circumsporozoite (CS) gene of the mouse malaria Plasmodium yoelii in an aroA S. typhimurium strain. Mice immunized with CS-expressing Salmonella recombinants mount a CS-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response. This is the first demonstration that attenuated Salmonella can elicit a specific CTL response to a foreign protein in mice. The ability to easily and stably express foreign genes from the Salmonella chromosome and the generation of specific CTL greatly expands the potential of Salmonella as an antigen-delivery system.",1990
s41279,construction and evaluation of live attenuated vaccine strains of shigella flexneri and shigella dysenteriae 1.,"construction and evaluation of live attenuated vaccine strains of shigella flexneri and shigella dysenteriae 1.. Shigellosis is an invasive disease of the human colon which is particularly prevalent among children of the developing world. No proper vaccine is available to protect against this enteric disease. It is currently accepted that only live strains with attenuated virulence administered orally may elicit protective immunity at the level of the colonic mucosa, which is the exclusive site of multiplication of causative microorganisms such as Shigella flexneri and Shigella dysenteriae 1. We have constructed such vaccine candidates based on the destruction of virulence genes responsible for selected steps of the infection process. In S. flexneri, a combination of two mutations impairing cell-to-cell spread (icsA) and aerobactin production and transport (iuc, iut) which support growth within tissues provide a well tolerated and protective vaccine prototype against shigellosis in macaque monkeys. In S. dysenteriae 1, similar mutations are currently being introduced, in addition to one which eliminates the catalytic activity of Shiga toxin. These mutants and others will be tested soon in human phase I trials.",1990
s41282,recombinant bcg as a candidate oral vaccine vector.,"recombinant bcg as a candidate oral vaccine vector.. Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), currently the most widely used vaccine in the world, was originally administered for many years as an oral vaccine. The low frequency of serious complications, inexpensive production, and adjuvanticity make BCG an ideal candidate for a recombinant vaccine vehicle. Although mycobacteria are slow growing and not yet well characterized genetically, we have recently developed technology for the genetic manipulation of BCG and other mycobacteria. Phage and plasmid systems based on a shuttle strategy to manipulate DNA in Escherichia coli and transfer it to mycobacteria have been developed. We have established that the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase gene can be used as an effective selectable marker in the mycobacteria and that a foreign antigen from Mycobacterium leprae can be expressed in BCG. Furthermore, a thorough analysis of mycobacterial expression sequences has been undertaken to optimize the expression of foreign antigens in BCG. We constructed an expression probe shuttle plasmid with beta-galactosidase as reporter gene, and have used it successfully to identify multiple mycobacteriophage DNA sequences with varying levels of constitutive or regulable promoter activity. Further genetic advances required for development of recombinant BCG into an effective recombinant vaccine vehicle, including possibilities for oral administration, are adumbrated.",1990
s41284,vaccines against enterotoxigenic bacterial pathogens based on hybrid salmonella that express heterologous antigens.,"vaccines against enterotoxigenic bacterial pathogens based on hybrid salmonella that express heterologous antigens.. In this report, we examine two aspects in the development of a vaccine against enterotoxigenic bacterial pathogens based on hybrid Salmonella that express heterologous antigens. First, we describe the construction of a non-toxic fusion peptide for immunization against Escherichia coli that produce heat-labile (LT) and heat-stable (ST) enterotoxins. For that construction, the 5' terminus of the gene coding for ST was fused to the 3' terminus of the gene coding for the binding subunit of LT(LT-B). The ST gene was constructed synthetically with appropriate restriction sites to permit in-frame, downstream insertion. Maximum expression of ST antigenicity was obtained when a seven-amino-acid proline-containing linker was included between the LT-B and ST moieties. The purified LT-B/ST fusion peptide consisted of a single polypeptide chain with an apparent molecular weight of 18,000. The LT-B/ST fusion peptide was non-toxic and immunologic determinants of both LT and ST were recognized by antibodies directed against the native toxins. Animals immunized with either crude or purified preparations containing the hybrid molecule produced antibodies that were able to recognize native toxin in vitro. Significantly, these antibodies were able to neutralize the biological activity of native ST. The second aspect reported here examines a mechanism for stabilizing expression of heterologous antigens in attenuated Salmonella mutants by integration of the heterologous gene (LT-B) into the chromosome of the carrier. A comparative in vitro study of the levels of expression of LT-B between the cointegrate strain and an isogenic strain carrying the LT-B gene on a multicopy plasmid demonstrated that the initial levels of expression of both strains is similar, that the plasmid-carrying strain loses the ability to express the heterologous antigen very quickly and that the cointegrate continues to maintain and express the antigen without the requirement for a stabilizing antibiotic.",1990

The safety and efficacy of five prototype, live anthrax vaccines were studied in Hartley guinea pigs and CBA/J and A/J mice. Two of the strains, Bacillus anthracis FD111 and FD112, are Aro- mutants derived by Tn916 mutagenesis of B. anthracis UM23-1. Bacillus subtilis PA1 and PA2 contain a recombinant plasmid, pPA101 or pPA102, respectively, that carries the gene from B. anthracis encoding synthesis of protective antigen (PA). The final strain, B. subtilis PA7, was isolated in this study from B. subtilis DB104 transformed with pPA101. All five strains were less virulent in guinea pigs and A/J and CBA/J mice than the toxinogenic, nonencapsulated B. anthracis veterinary vaccine Sterne strain. A/J and CBA/J inbred mice represent strains that are innately susceptible and resistant, respectively, to the Sterne strain. These differences in susceptibility are due to differences in ability to produce complement component 5.

The gene encoding Bacillus anthracis protective antigen (PA) was modified by site-directed mutagenesis, subcloned into baculovirus and vaccinia virus plasmid transfer vectors (pAcYM1 and pSC-11, respectively), and inserted via homologous recombinations into baculovirus Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus or vaccinia virus (strains WR and Connaught). Expression of PA was detected in both systems by immunofluorescence assays with antisera from rabbits immunized with B. anthracis PA. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis showed that the expressed product of both systems was slightly larger (86 kilodaltons) than B. anthracis-produced PA (83.5 kilodaltons). Analysis of trypsin digests of virus-expressed and authentic PA suggested that the size difference was due to the presence of a signal sequence remaining with the virus-expressed protein. Immunization of mice with either recombinant baculovirus-infected Spodoptera frugiperda cells or with vaccinia virus recombinants elicited a high-titer, anti-PA antibody response.",1990
s41608,"cloning of the genes for t84.66, an antibody that has a high specificity and affinity for carcinoembryonic antigen, and expression of chimeric human/mouse t84.66 genes in myeloma and chinese hamster ovary cells.","cloning of the genes for t84.66, an antibody that has a high specificity and affinity for carcinoembryonic antigen, and expression of chimeric human/mouse t84.66 genes in myeloma and chinese hamster ovary cells.. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is one of the best characterized tumor-associated antigens and is extensively used in the in vitro immunodiagnosis of human colon adenocarcinomas. Among a number of anti-CEA monoclonal antibodies, the murine monoclonal antibody T84.66 shows the highest specificity and affinity for CEA and has been used successfully for in vivo tumor imaging in mice and humans. We report here the cloning and sequencing of the genes coding for monoclonal antibody T84.66 and the amino acid sequence of the variable regions for the heavy and light chains. We also report the construction of mouse/human chimeric IgG1 antibody genes using T84.66 variable region genes and human constant region genes. The resulting chimeric gene constructs were transfected into murine myeloma cells (Sp2/0) by electroporation and into Chinese hamster ovary cells by lipofection. The chimeric antibodies obtained exhibited the same specificity and affinity for CEA as that of the T84.66 immunoglobulin produced by the murine hybridoma cell line. Antibody concentrations in culture medium supernatants were clonally variable but similar (15-480 ng/ml) for both Sp2/0 and Chinese hamster ovary transfectants; the average production by Chinese hamster ovary transfectants was only 3-5-fold less than Sp2/0 transfectants. Ascites production of Sp2/0 transfectants is sufficiently high (900 micrograms/ml) for initial in vivo studies with humanized T84.66.",1990

A monoclonal antibody, H23, that specifically recognizes a breast-tumor-associated antigen, was used to isolate a cDNA insert that codes for the antigenic epitope. Nucleotide sequencing of this cDNA, as well as a longer 850-bp cDNA insert, shows that they are composed of 60-bp (G + C)-rich tandem repeating units. The coding strand was determined and codes for a proline-rich 20-amino-acid repeat motif. A comparison of the highly conserved repeat unit with the deduced flanking amino acid sequences demonstrates conservation of specific subregions of the repeat consensus within the flanking amino acids. Hybridization of the 60-bp cDNA probe with RNAs extracted from a variety of primary and metastatic human tumors yields relatively high levels of hybrid with the breast carcinomas, as compared to lower hybrid levels with RNAs from other epithelial tumors. RNA extracted from breast tissue adjacent to the tumor or from benign breast tumors, demonstrates low or undetectable levels of hybridization. Probing Southern blots with the 60-bp repeat shows that the tumor antigen is highly polymorphic and contains a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs). The VNTR nature of the gene was confirmed by probing Southern blots with unique genomic sequences that are physically linked to an isolated gene fragment that also contains the tandem repeat array. Mouse cells transfected with this gene fragment produce tumor antigen that is readily detected by H23 monoclonal antibodies. The allelic forms seen in 10 different primary human tumors demonstrate 100% concordance with the various mRNA species expressed. These studies are extended to the protein forms detected by immunoblot analyses that show both a correlation of the expressed tumor antigen species with the allelic forms as well as significantly increased expression in breast cancer tissue. The above studies unequivocally establish the over-expression of a VNTR gene coding for an epithelial tumor antigen in human breast cancer tissue.",1990

The two monoclonal antibodies (mAb), L6 (anti-carcinoma), and 1F5 [anti-(B-cell-lymphoma)], were chemically linked to the enzyme penicillin-V amidase (PVA), which hydrolyzes phenoxyacetamides, to explore the potential of using mAb-enzyme conjugates for the localization of chemotherapeutic drugs at tumor cells. The phenoxyacetamide derivatives of doxorubicin and melphalan were prepared, yielding the less toxic amides, doxorubicin-N-p-hydroxyphenoxyacetamide (DPO) and melphalan-N-p-hydroxyphenoxyacetamide (MelPO). These were hydrolyzed by PVA to doxorubicin and melphalan respectively. In vitro studies with the L6-positive lung carcinoma cell line, H2981, and the 1F5-positive B-cell lymphoma line, Daudi, showed that DPO was 80-fold less toxic to H2981 cells and 20-fold less toxic to Daudi cells than doxorubicin, and its toxicity was substantially increased when the H2981 cells were pretreated with L6-PVA or the Daudi cells were pretreated with 1F5-PVA. The cytotoxic effect was antigen-specific, since only the binding mAb-enzyme conjugate increased the cytotoxicity of the prodrug. MelPO was more than 1000-fold less toxic than melphalan to H2981 cells and more than 100-fold less toxic than melphalan to Daudi cells. Pretreatment with the mAb-PVA conjugates did not enhance the toxicity of MelPO in either cell line, because PVA hydrolyzes the phenoxyacetamide bond of MelPO too slowly to generate a toxic level of melphalan.",1990

A 3.8-kilobase PstI fragment proximal to the 5' end of the gene was found to consist of 13 highly related tandem repeats which constituted over 40% of the coding region. The repeated sequences could be divided into either a 225-nucleotide, 75-amino-acid unit (type I) or a 216-nucleotide, 72-amino-acid unit (type II), with extensive homology between the two types of repeating units. The deduced amino acid sequence for these repeat units, overall, was slightly hydrophobic with short hydrophilic domains. The carboxy-terminal (nonrepetitive) portion of the deduced protein sequence was hydrophilic, with potential surface-exposed epitopes. The full-length reading frame was reconstructed in Escherichia coli, and transient expression of the 190-kilodalton antigen was demonstrated; however, the protein appeared to be severely degraded by proteases and was apparently toxic to E. coli. The conservation of this unique repetitive gene structure, coupled with results from previous reports showing the protective properties of the 190-kilodalton antigen, suggests that this protein plays an important role in the pathogenesis of and immunity to Rocky Mountain spotted fever.",1990
s42093,cloning and characterization of t-cell-reactive protein antigens from listeria monocytogenes.,"cloning and characterization of t-cell-reactive protein antigens from listeria monocytogenes.. To explore the molecular basis of the T-cell-mediated immune response to Listeria monocytogenes, we cloned and expressed listerial antigens in Escherichia coli using the lambda-ZAP bacteriophage and Bluescript plasmid vectors. A two-stage screening strategy was implemented to identify T-cell-reactive antigens; the first stage involved antibodies or oligonucleotide probes and the second stage was based on assays for T-cell activation. A library of genomic DNA from L. monocytogenes was generated in lambda-ZAP, and then antigens, were detected in infected cells with a polyclonal rabbit anti-L. monocytogenes antiserum and an L. monocytogenes-specific monoclonal antibody. Also, synthetic oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the structural gene for listeriolysin O (LLO) were used to screen the recombinant DNA library. In each case, positive isolates were evaluated for T-cell antigenicity by measuring antigen-induced interleukin-2 production by polyclonal T cells taken from L. monocytogenes-immune mice. Phage clones were subcloned and expressed in the Bluescript plasmid and tested further for antigenic activity and LLO expression. Using this screening strategy, we successfully identified bacterial clones producing recombinant listerial antigens which activate L. monocytogenes-immune T cells in vitro. Antigens operative in the T-cell response during infection with L. monocytogenes include LLO, 62- and 39-kilodalton proteins, and other poorly defined bacterial surface components. We also found that high concentrations of recombinant LLO inhibited macrophage-mediated antigen presentation. These results are discussed in terms of the multiple functions of LLO as a virulence factor, inhibitor of antigen presentation, and potent antigen in the T-cell response to L. monocytogenes. These studies represent the first step toward a genetic definition of the antigens recognized in immune defense to L. monocytogenes.",1990
s42094,oral immunization with recombinant streptococcus lactis carrying the streptococcus mutans surface protein antigen gene.,"oral immunization with recombinant streptococcus lactis carrying the streptococcus mutans surface protein antigen gene.. A recombinant Streptococcus lactis strain which carries the structural gene for a surface protein antigen (PAc) of 190,000 daltons from Streptococcus mutans serotype c was constructed for development of an oral vaccine against dental caries. The gene from S. mutans MT8148 joined to shuttle vector pSA3 was successfully transformed into S. lactis IL1403. A small amount of PAc was detected in the cell homogenate and cytoplasmic fraction of the recombinant S. lactis, but not in the culture supernatant of the recombinant, by Western immunoblotting and dot immunoblotting. The level of PAc-specific mRNA in the recombinant strain was lower than that in S. mutans MT8148. However, significant salivary immunoglobulin A and serum immunoglobulin G responses to PAc were induced in mice immunized orally with the recombinant S. lactis.",1990
s42134,expression cloning of a cdna encoding m1/69-j11d heat-stable antigens.,"expression cloning of a cdna encoding m1/69-j11d heat-stable antigens.. The differentiation Ag identified by the mAb M1/69 and J11d (commonly referred to as heat-stable Ag) are found in structurally heterogeneous forms on the surfaces of many types of murine hemopoietic cells. The extinction of expression of these antigens is associated with thymocyte maturation and Ig class switching in B cells, as well as terminal differentiation of macrophages. A cDNA encoding the M1/69-J11d peptide was cloned from a hemopoietic progenitor cell line by immunoselection of COS cells transfected with expression libraries. The cloned cDNA is a copy of a gene that is transcribed in M1/69-J11d+ lymphoid, myeloid, and erythroid cells. This gene could be responsible for the expression of all forms of the M1/69-J11d Ag, although there are homologous genes that may encode some forms of the Ag that are specifically expressed in bone marrow. The cloned cDNA encodes a surprisingly small peptide, predicted to contain only 30 amino acids after removal of a signal sequence and displacement of the C-terminal region by the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol group that anchors the peptide to the cell surface. Almost all of the mass of the M1/69-J11d Ag accumulates through extensive N- and O-linked glycosylation at multiple sites in the short peptide. These carbohydrates are likely to execute the functions of M1/69-J11d Ag, which could be specialized to each cell type as a consequence of differential glycosylation.",1990
s42163,"molecular cloning, sequence, and expression of a human gdp-l-fucose:beta-d-galactoside 2-alpha-l-fucosyltransferase cdna that can form the h blood group antigen.","molecular cloning, sequence, and expression of a human gdp-l-fucose:beta-d-galactoside 2-alpha-l-fucosyltransferase cdna that can form the h blood group antigen.. We have previously used a gene-transfer scheme to isolate a human genomic DNA fragment that determines expression of a GDP-L-fucose:beta-D-galactoside 2-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase [alpha(1,2)FT; EC 2.4.1.69]. Although this fragment determined expression of an alpha(1,2)FT whose kinetic properties mirror those of the human H blood group alpha(1,2)FT, their precise nature remained undefined. We describe here the molecular cloning, sequence, and expression of a human cDNA corresponding to these human genomic sequences. When expressed in COS-1 cells, this cDNA directs expression of cell surface H structures and a cognate alpha(1,2)FT activity with properties analogous to the human H blood group alpha(1,2)FT. The cDNA sequence predicts a 365-amino acid polypeptide characteristic of a type II transmembrane glycoprotein with a domain structure analogous to that of other glycosyltransferases but without significant primary sequence similarity to these or other known proteins. To directly demonstrate that the cDNA encodes an alpha(1,2)FT, the COOH-terminal domain predicted to be Golgi-resident was expressed in COS-1 cells as a catalytically active, secreted, and soluble protein A fusion peptide. Southern blot analysis showed that this cDNA identifies DNA sequences syntenic to the human H locus on chromosome 19. These results strongly suggest that this cloned alpha(1,2)FT cDNA represents the product of the human H blood group locus.",1990
s42223,mutations of immunoglobulin transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains: effects on intracellular signaling and antigen presentation.,"mutations of immunoglobulin transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains: effects on intracellular signaling and antigen presentation.. The membrane-bound form of immunoglobulin serves as an antigen-specific receptor for B cells mediating signal transduction and antigen presentation. We have developed an assay that reconstitutes both these physiologic responses with respect to the antigen phosphorylcholine. By introducing specific mutations in the human Ig mu chain gene, we have shown that certain transmembrane residues and the short cytoplasmic domain are crucial for these two activities. Moreover, elimination of a single transmembrane hydroxyl group severely inhibits antigen presentation without affecting signal transduction, suggesting that these two functions are mediated by different protein interactions.",1990
s42380,single cell assay of a transcription factor reveals a threshold in transcription activated by signals emanating from the t-cell antigen receptor.,"single cell assay of a transcription factor reveals a threshold in transcription activated by signals emanating from the t-cell antigen receptor.. Stimulation of T lymphocytes through their antigen receptor leads to the appearance of several transcription factors, including NF-AT and NF-kappa B, which are involved in regulating genes required for immunologic activation. To investigate the activity of a single transcription factor in individual viable cells, we have applied an assay that uses the fluorescence-activated cell sorter to quantitate beta-galactosidase (beta-gal). We have analyzed the distribution of NF-AT transcriptional activity among T cells undergoing activation by using a construct in which three tandem copies of the NF-AT-binding site directs transcription of the lacZ gene. Unexpectedly, stimulation of cloned stably transfected Jurkat T cells leads to a bimodal pattern of beta-gal expression in which some cells express no beta-gal and others express high levels. This expression pattern cannot be accounted for by cell-cycle position or heritable variation. Further results, in which beta-gal activity is correlated with NF-AT-binding activity, indicate that the concentration of NF-AT must exceed a critical threshold before transcription initiates. This threshold likely reflects the NF-AT concentration-dependent assembly of transcription complexes at the promoter. Similar constructs controlled by NF-kappa B or the entire interleukin-2 enhancer show bimodal expression patterns during induction, suggesting that thresholds set by the concentration of transcription factors may be a common property of inducible genes.",1990
s42442,development of a stable leishmania expression vector and application to the study of parasite surface antigen genes.,"development of a stable leishmania expression vector and application to the study of parasite surface antigen genes.. Trypanosomatid protozoan parasites cause several important tropical diseases and have been a fertile ground for the discovery of molecular paradigms such as trans-splicing and RNA editing. Transfection-based methods for the study of these organisms have recently been developed, and we have now designed an expression vector, pX, which contains only 2.3 kilobases of Leishmania DNA and can be stably transfected with high efficiency. Genes encoding Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase or a Leishmania amazonensis protective membrane glycoprotein (GP46A/M-2) were inserted into the pX expression site and transfected into Leishmania major, where they directed the synthesis of high levels of mRNAs formed by 5' and 3' processing events occurring predominantly at the sites used by the normal transcripts. Colony assays and immunoblot analysis showed that both proteins were produced; enzymatically active beta-galactosidase comprised approximately 1% of total protein. Sizes of the GP46A protein synthesized in transfected L. major or L. amazonensis were similar and differed from the predominant L. amazonensis GP46, suggesting that the GP46A gene may encode a variant GP46 family member. Because these vectors function efficiently in pathogenic species of Leishmania, pX will facilitate the genetic analyses of parasite proteins crucial for infectivity as well as the identification of cis-acting elements mediating transcription and replication.",1990
s42744,class i-restricted processing and presentation of exogenous cell-associated antigen in vivo.,"class i-restricted processing and presentation of exogenous cell-associated antigen in vivo.. MHC class I-restricted T lymphocyte responses are usually directed to cellular antigenic components resulting from endogenous gene expression. Exogenous, non-replicating antigens, such as soluble proteins, usually fail to enter the class I pathway of antigen processing and presentation. Consistent with this notion, we have recently shown that soluble, exogenous proteins can be efficiently processed for class I presentation in vitro only if they are introduced directly into the target cell cytoplasm. In this report we extend this work to the in vivo situation by introducing soluble protein into the cytoplasm of mouse splenocytes via the osmotic lysis of pinosomes and then using these cells for in vivo immunization. Our results show that cytoplasmic loading of OVA and beta-GAL into H-2b and H-2d splenocytes respectively, resulted in effective in vivo immunogens for class I-restricted CTL. To our surprise, control spleen cell preparations simply incubated with the exogenous, native protein for 10 min at 37 degrees C in isotonic medium and then washed could also induce a comparable class I-restricted CTL response following intravenous injection. Experiments using (H-2b X H-2d)F1 mice showed that protein pulsed splenocytes from one parental strain could effectively """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""cross prime"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" T cells restricted to the MHC of the other parental strain. In all cases, target cell recognition by the effector CTL generated by immunization with spleen cell-associated antigen required the antigen to be present in the cell cytoplasm. Thus the CTL do not recognize target cells exposed to soluble, exogenous antigen. These results, reminiscent of analogous experiments with cross priming by minor histocompatibility antigens, argue that class I-restricted processing and presentation of exogenous antigen can occur in vivo following immunization with cell-associated antigen.",1990
s42770,"a method to generate antigen-specific suppressor t cells in vitro from peripheral blood t cells of honey bee venom-sensitive, allergic patients.","a method to generate antigen-specific suppressor t cells in vitro from peripheral blood t cells of honey bee venom-sensitive, allergic patients.. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients allergic to honey bee venom were stimulated with denatured bee venom phospholipase A2, and the antigen-activated T cells were propagated for 4 days by human IL-2 in the presence or absence of recombinant human lipocortin I. Upon antigenic stimulation with the denatured phospholipase A2 and autologous monocytes or by cross-linking of CD3 by anti-CD3 antibody, the activated T cells, which had propagated by IL-2 alone, formed N-glycosylated IgE-binding factors and glycosylation enhancing factor (GEF), while those propagated in the presence of lipocortin formed unglycosylated IgE-binding factors and glycosylation inhibiting factor (GIF). The GEF and GIF formed by the antigen- or anti-CD3-stimulated T cells had affinity for bee venom phospholipase A2 and could be purified by using anti-lipomodulin Sepharose. In the mouse lymphocyte system, the major cell source of GIF is antigen-specific suppressor T cells, and the antigen-binding GIF from the cells suppressed the in vivo antibody response in an antigen (carrier)-specific manner. In view of the findings in the mouse system, the present results may provide an immunological maneuver to generate allergen-specific suppressor T cells, and to obtain allergen-specific suppressor factor from T cell populations in the peripheral blood of allergic patients.",1990
s42991,secondary structure and immunogenicity of hybrid synthetic peptides derived from two plasmodium falciparum pre-erythrocytic antigens.,"secondary structure and immunogenicity of hybrid synthetic peptides derived from two plasmodium falciparum pre-erythrocytic antigens.. Multicomponent synthetic vaccines containing both B and T cell epitopes belonging to two different pre-erythrocytic Ag of Plasmodium falciparum are presented. In a di-component hybrid, a circumsporozoite T cell epitope and a peptide representing a liver stage-specific Ag were connected to obtain a reciprocal reinforcement of helical potentials. In a tri-component hybrid, a sequence corresponding to the circumsporozoite repeat tetrapeptide (NPNA) was tandemly synthesized on the N-terminal end of the di-component hybrid. Both hybrid molecules were able to adopt a partial helical conformation in water as determined by circular dichroism studies. To analyze if the different components were immunologically functional in these vaccines, mich bearing genetic backgrounds known to respond or not to the individual components were immunized with the hybrids. The tri-hybrid peptide showed high immunogenic capacity as it elicited, in both H-2b and H-2k mice, high antibody responses against every separate individual sequence. Moreover, the antibodies induced by these conformationally restricted peptides were able to recognize the corresponding native proteins in the liver schizont and the sporozoite surface. H-2d mice, in which the immune response to the individual components was genetically restricted, did respond against the di-hybrid peptide. The tri-hybrid peptide, in which NPNA repeats were present, lacked this H-2d-priming capacity but it triggered antibody production in H-2d mice previously primed with the di-hybrid peptide. These results indicate that multivalent vaccines can provide positive (potentiating) effects by carefully combining structurally well defined epitopes; however, negative (suppressive) effects are also possible suggesting that selection of multivalent vaccine components will require testing of combined molecules to optimize specific immune responses and avoid undesirable effects which may result from negative molecular interactions.",1990
s43028,oral salmonella typhimurium (aroa-) vaccine expressing a major leishmanial surface protein (gp63) preferentially induces t helper 1 cells and protective immunity against leishmaniasis.,"oral salmonella typhimurium (aroa-) vaccine expressing a major leishmanial surface protein (gp63) preferentially induces t helper 1 cells and protective immunity against leishmaniasis.. The gp63 gene of Leishmania major was transformed into the AroA- vaccine strain of Salmonella typhimurium (SL3261). The construct (SL3261-gp63), which stably expresses the gp63 Ag in vitro, was used to immunize CBA mice by the oral route. Spleen cells from mice inoculated with SL3261-gp63 developed antibody and proliferative T cell response to L. major. They did not express detectable delayed-type hypersensitivity reactivity. The activated T cells are mainly CD4+ and secrete IL-2 and IFN-gamma but no IL-4. The orally immunized mice developed significant resistance against a challenge L. major infection. We have, therefore, demonstrated the feasibility of oral vaccination against leishmaniasis and that the oral route of antigen delivery via the heterologous carrier may preferentially induce Th1 subsets of CD4+ cells.",1990
s43154,method for identifying microbial antigens that stimulate specific lymphocyte responses: application to salmonella.,"method for identifying microbial antigens that stimulate specific lymphocyte responses: application to salmonella.. Vaccine development and understanding of cellular immune stimulatory mechanisms have been impeded by the paucity of data on microbial antigens that stimulate protective immunity. We describe here a general method for identifying and isolating peptide antigens that specifically stimulate sensitized lymphocytes. First, Salmonella typhimurium C5 genomic DNA fragments were subcloned into Escherichia coli by use of the lambda gt11 expression vector. Next, antigens expressed by recombinant phage from this genomic library were tested for their capacity to stimulate proliferative responses in pooled lymphocytes obtained from BALB/c mice infected 14 days earlier with S. typhimurium. Of 2000 recombinant phages tested, 5 stimulated a polypeptide-antigen-specific proliferative response. Physical analyses of these 5 recombinant phages revealed cloned inserts of 0.5-2.4 kilobase pairs representing nonoverlapping regions of the C5 chromosome. Four of the five insert DNAs hybridized at high stringency to both S. typhimurium and Salmonella typhi total chromosomal DNA, suggesting that these pathogens of different host specificity share several antigenic determinants. Use of sensitized primary polyclonal lymphocytes provides a rapid and simple method for screening recombinant DNA libraries for clones that stimulate specific immune responses and avoids the use of cloned lymphocyte cell lines. This approach should be generally applicable to similar studies in different hosts of many other microbial pathogens.",1990
s43202,co-expression of the human hla-b27 class i antigen and the e3/19k protein of adenovirus-2 in insect cells using a baculovirus vector.,"co-expression of the human hla-b27 class i antigen and the e3/19k protein of adenovirus-2 in insect cells using a baculovirus vector.. We have expressed the human MHC class I HLA-B27 antigen, human beta 2-microglobulin, and the E3/19K protein of adenovirus-2 in Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells (Sf9) by using the Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus. All genes were inserted under the strong polyhedrin promoter in the vector pVL941. The proteins were expressed at high levels, ranging from 1 to 8 mg protein per 3 x 10(9) cells. Both a full-length and a truncated form of HLA-B27 were expressed. The latter was terminated at the border of the membrane-spanning segment at the extracellular side of the membrane. The HLA-B27 antigens and the E3/19K protein showed considerable heterogeneity with respect to glycosylation. Only a small fraction of HLA-B27 was assembled (less than 5%) with beta 2-microglobulin. Nevertheless, we were able to find the heavy chain at the cell surface, and by co-infection with the recombinant virus for beta 2-microglobulin we observed an increase in cell surface expression. The E3/19K protein of adenovirus-2 blocks cell surface expression of HLA class I antigens in human cells and has a similar effect in insect cells. In contrast to beta 2-microglobulin it assembles efficiently to the heavy HLA-B27 chain, both the full-length and truncated forms. The E3/19K protein does not stimulate assembly of HLA-B27-beta 2-microglobulin. Due to these problems of assembly and the heterogeneity of glycosylation we predict that it will be difficult to use HLA antigens produced in insect cells for X-ray crystallographic studies.",1990
s43362,pseudorabies virus glycoprotein giii is a major target antigen for murine and swine virus-specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes.,"pseudorabies virus glycoprotein giii is a major target antigen for murine and swine virus-specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes.. Pseudorabies virus (PrV) is the etiological agent of Aujeszky's disease, a disease that causes heavy economic losses in the swine industry. A rational approach to the generation of an effective vaccine against this virus requires an understanding of the immune response induced by it and of the role of the various viral antigens in inducing such a response. We have constructed mutants of PrV [strain PrV (Ka)] that differ from each other only in expression of the viral nonessential glycoproteins gI, gp63, gX, and gIII (i.e., are otherwise isogenic). These mutants were used to ascertain the importance of each of the nonessential glycoproteins in eliciting a PrV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response in mice and pigs. Immunization of DBA/2 mice and pigs with a thymidine kinase-deficient (TK-) mutant of PrV elicits the formation of cytotoxic cells that specifically lyse syngeneic infected target cells. These PrV-specific cytolytic cells have the phenotype of major histocompatibility complex class I antigen-restricted CTLs. The relative number of CTLs specific for glycoproteins gI, gp63, gX, and gIII induced in mice vaccinated with a TK- mutant of PrV was ascertained by comparing their levels of cytotoxicity against syngeneic cells infected with either wild-type virus or gI-/gp63-, gX-, or gIII- virus deletion mutants. The PrV-specific CLTs were significantly less effective in lysing gIII(-)-infected targets than in lysing gI-/gp63-, gX-, or wild-type-infected targets. The in vitro secondary CTL response of lymphocytes obtained from either mice or pigs 6 or more weeks after immunization with a TK- mutant of PrV was also tested. Lymphocytes obtained from these animals were cultured with different glycoprotein-deficient mutants of PrV, and their cytolytic activities against wild-type-infected targets were ascertained. The importance of each of the nonessential viral glycoproteins in eliciting CTLs was assessed from the effectiveness of each of the virus mutants to stimulate the secondary anti-PrV CTL response. Cultures of both murine or swine lymphocytes that had been stimulated with gIII- virus contained only approximately half as many lytic units as did those stimulated with either wild-type virus, a gX- virus mutant, or a gI-/gp63- virus mutant. Thus, a large proportion of the PrV-specific CTLs that are induced by immunization with PrV of both mice and pigs are directed against gIII. Furthermore, glycoproteins gI, gp63, and gX play at most a minor role in the CTL response of these animals to PrV.",1990
s43460,stable transfection of epstein-barr virus (ebv) nuclear antigen 2 in lymphoma cells containing the ebv p3hr1 genome induces expression of b-cell activation molecules cd21 and cd23.,"stable transfection of epstein-barr virus (ebv) nuclear antigen 2 in lymphoma cells containing the ebv p3hr1 genome induces expression of b-cell activation molecules cd21 and cd23.. A set of B-cell activation molecules, including the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) receptor CR2 (CD21) and the B-cell activation antigen CD23 (Blast2/Fc epsilon RII), is turned on by infecting EBV-negative B-lymphoma cell lines with immortalizing strains of the viruslike B95-8 (BL/B95 cells). This up regulation may represent one of the mechanisms involved in EBV-mediated B-cell immortalization. The P3HR1 nonimmortalizing strain of the virus, which is deleted for the entire Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) protein open reading frame, is incapable of inducing the expression of CR2 and CD23, suggesting a crucial role for EBNA2 in the activation of these molecules. In addition, lymphoma cells containing the P3HR1 genome (BL/P3HR1 cells) do not express the viral latent membrane protein (LMP), which is regularly expressed in cells infected with immortalizing viral strains. Using electroporation, we have transfected the EBNA2 gene cloned in an episomal vector into BL/P3HR1 cells and have obtained cell clones that stably express the EBNA2 protein. In these clones, EBNA2 expression was associated with an increased amount of CR2 and CD23 steady-state RNAs. Of the three species of CD23 mRNAs described, the Fc epsilon RIIa species was preferentially expressed in these EBNA2-expressing clones. An increased cell surface expression of CR2 but not of CD23 was observed, and the soluble form of CD23 molecule (SCD23) was released. We were, however, not able to detect any expression of LMP in these cell clones. These data demonstrate that EBNA2 gene is able to complement P3HR1 virus latent functions to induce the activation of CR2 and CD23 expression, and they emphasize the role of EBNA2 protein in the modulation of cellular gene implicated in B-cell proliferation and hence in EBV-mediated B-cell immortalization. Nevertheless, EBNA2 expression in BL/P3HR1 cells is not able to restore the level of CR2 and CD23 expression observed in BL/B95 cells, suggesting that other cellular or viral proteins may also have an important role in the activation of these molecules: the viral LMP seems to be a good candidate.",1990
s43625,homotypic and heterotypic epitope-specific antibody responses in adult and infant rotavirus vaccinees: implications for vaccine development.,"homotypic and heterotypic epitope-specific antibody responses in adult and infant rotavirus vaccinees: implications for vaccine development.. Sera from infants and adults who received a live, attenuated monovalent rotavirus vaccine of serotype 1, 2, 3, or 4 VP7 specificity and rhesus rotavirus (RRV) VP4 specificity were analyzed for serotype-specific antibody responses by an epitope blocking immunoassay (EBA) and by neutralization. Although the assays correlated well, responses to the individual neutralization proteins or to different defined antigenic sites on the same protein could be distinguished only by EBA. In general, adult vaccinees exhibited both a homotypic response to the immunizing strain and a heterotypic response to other serotypes. Infant vaccinees less than 6 months old also had a homotypic antibody response but developed significantly fewer heterotypic responses than adults (1.2% and 59%, respectively; P less than .0001). In addition, postvaccination sera from vaccinees who developed naturally occurring rotavirus diarrhea during an efficacy trial of RRV (MMU-18006) or RIT 4237 vaccine were analyzed for serotype-specific responses. The data suggest that the inability to mount a heterotypic antibody response to the infecting serotypes in young infants may have been an important factor in failure of the vaccines to induce protection.",1990
s43670,virulence of infectious laryngotracheitis viruses: comparison of modified-live vaccine viruses and north carolina field isolates.,"virulence of infectious laryngotracheitis viruses: comparison of modified-live vaccine viruses and north carolina field isolates.. Virulence of six modified-live (ML) infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) vaccine viruses was compared with that of 11 field isolates (indistinguishable from vaccine viruses by DNA restriction endonuclease analyses) by intratracheal exposure of 4-week-old, specific-pathogen-free chickens. Virulence of ILT viruses was based on an intratracheal pathogenicity index, mortality, and tracheal lesions. Intratracheal pathogenicity indices for ML vaccine viruses ranged from 0.0 to 0.14, while those for field isolates were 0.20 to 0.82. Mortality was a consistent clinical feature of field isolates; all produced mortality, with seven of the 11 isolates causing two or more deaths per inoculation group. In contrast, only one of six ML vaccine viruses produced mortality (one death per inoculation group). In general, tracheal lesions were more severe in chickens inoculated with field isolates and were produced more consistently than in chickens inoculated with vaccine viruses. These studies indicate that virulence of ILT field isolates was greater than that of ML vaccine viruses. Together with previous restriction endonuclease analyses, these findings suggest the possibility that field isolates originated from ML vaccine viruses through reversion to parental-type virulence.",1990
s43698,the murine homologue of the t lymphocyte antigen cd28. molecular cloning and cell surface expression.,"the murine homologue of the t lymphocyte antigen cd28. molecular cloning and cell surface expression.. The human T lymphocyte Ag CD28 (Tp44) is a homodimeric glycoprotein expressed on the surface of a majority of human peripheral T cells and thymocytes. Although exposure of T cells to anti-CD28 mAb does not activate T cells, stimulation of CD28 can synergize with signals transmitted through the TCR or other stimuli to augment proliferation and lymphokine production. We have used a portion of the human CD28 cDNA to isolate a homologous murine cDNA from an EL4 T lymphoma library. The murine clone has 61% nucleotide identity with the human cDNA. Both human and murine sequences exhibit homology with members of the Ig supergene family and CTLA-4, a T cell specific murine gene. Many characteristics of the human CD28 molecule are conserved within the putative murine CD28 polypeptide. The murine cDNA sequence encodes a polypeptide of 218 amino acids that has 68% identity with the human sequence. Both the murine and human molecules are integral membrane glycoproteins with hydrophobic signal peptide sequences and transmembrane region. All five potential N-linked glycosylation sites are conserved and six of the seven cysteine residues of the mouse protein are found in the human CD28 polypeptide. The murine cDNA is encoded by a single copy nonrearranging gene whose expression at the mRNA level is restricted to T cells. A rabbit antiserum was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to a hydrophilic portion of the translated murine cDNA sequence. This antiserum identifies an 80-kDa homodimer consisting of disulfide-bonded subunits of 40 kDa that is expressed on splenic T cells, thymocytes, and several T cell tumors, but not on B cells. deglycosylation studies indicate that four of the five N-linked glycosylation sites are used and that the mature core protein has a molecular mass of 25 kDa, close to that predicted by the cDNA sequence. Transfection of the murine cDNA into Chinese hamster ovary cells resulted in the expression of an 80-kDa dimeric molecule that was immunoprecipitated by the antipeptide antiserum. Taken together, these data provide strong support that we have identified the murine homologue of CD28.",1990
s44001,identification of a region of simian virus 40 large t antigen required for cell transformation.,"identification of a region of simian virus 40 large t antigen required for cell transformation.. A series of replication-competent simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigens with point and deletion mutations in the amino acid sequence between residues 105 and 115 were examined for the ability to immortalize primary cultures of mouse and rat cells. The results show that certain mutants, including one that deletes the entire region, are able to immortalize. However, consistent with previous data, the immortalized cells are not fully transformed, as judged by doubling time, sensitivity to concentrations of serum, and anchorage-independent growth. The region from 106 to 114 has structural features in common with a region involved in transformation by adenovirus E1a protein (J. Figge, T. Webster, T.F. Smith, and E. Paucha, J.

Paucha, and D.M. Livingston, Cell 54:275-283, 1988). Together, these results imply that the sequence from 106 to 114 forms part of a domain that is essential for transformation of established cells, is dispensable for immortalization, and is not required for SV40 replication. The results also indicate that the ability of SV40 large T to immortalize primary cells is independent of its ability to bind to the retinoblastoma gene product.",1990
s44183,mammalian cell transient expression of tissue factor for the production of antigen.,"mammalian cell transient expression of tissue factor for the production of antigen.. We describe a mammalian cell expression system used to rapidly produce microgram quantities of a membrane protein used as an immunogen. A fusion protein expression vector was constructed which contained the signal sequence and 27 amino acids of the Herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D (gD), followed by a factor VIII (fVIII) thrombin cleavage site and the mature tissue factor (TF) sequence. This fusion protein was transiently expressed and then purified using an antibody to gD. The purified fusion protein, gDTF, was incubated with thrombin to remove the gD-fVIII moiety and the resulting rTF served as antigen for the generation of TF-specific antibodies. The antibodies produced were then used for a comparison of the turnover rates of the constitutively and transiently produced fusion protein. In addition, sensitivity to glycosidases indicated that the transiently and constitutively produced recombinant proteins do not contain identical carbohydrate structures.",1990
s44234,inactivation of the thymidine kinase gene of a gi deletion mutant of pseudorabies virus generates a safe but still highly immunogenic vaccine strain.,"inactivation of the thymidine kinase gene of a gi deletion mutant of pseudorabies virus generates a safe but still highly immunogenic vaccine strain.. In an earlier report, we described the construction of the genetically engineered pseudorabies virus strain 2.4N3A which does not express glycoprotein gI. Although this strain showed a strongly reduced virulence in 10-week-old seronegative pigs, it could still cause severe disease or death in 3-day-old piglets. To attenuate the strain further, we constructed mutants with a deletion in the viral thymidine kinase gene. One mutant strain, designated 783, has a deletion of 19 base pairs and was shown to be highly immunogenic and safe for vaccination of pigs against pseudorabies virus.",1990
s44290,biosynthesis of enterobacterial common antigen in escherichia coli. biochemical characterization of tn10 insertion mutants defective in enterobacterial common antigen synthesis.,"biosynthesis of enterobacterial common antigen in escherichia coli. biochemical characterization of tn10 insertion mutants defective in enterobacterial common antigen synthesis.. Twelve independent Tn10 insertion mutants of Escherichia coli K12 were isolated that were defective in the synthesis of enterobacterial common antigen (ECA). The mutants were identified by screening a random pool of Tn10 insertion mutants for their ECA phenotype using a colony-immunoblot assay. All 12 of the Tn10 insertion mutants were found to be located in the chromosomal region of the rff-rfe genes. Four of the Tn10 insertions were in rfe genes while the remaining eight Tn10 insertions were in rff genes. All of the rfe::Tn10 insertion mutants were defective in the synthesis of GlcNAc-pyrophosphorylundecaprenol (C55-PP-GlcNAc, lipid I), the first lipid-linked intermediate involved in ECA synthesis. Biochemical characterization of the rff::Tn10 insertion mutants revealed that they were defective in various steps of ECA synthesis subsequent to the synthesis of lipid I. These defects included: (i) the inability to synthesize UDP-ManNAcA due to Tn10 insertions in the structural genes for UDP-GlcNAc-2-epimerase (rffE) and UDP-ManNAcA (N-acetyl-D-mannosaminuronic acid) dehydrogenase (rffD), (ii) defects in the synthesis of C55-GlcNAc-ManNAcA (lipid II) due to insertion of transposon Tn10 in the structural gene for the UDP-ManNAcA transferase (rffM), (iii) the inability to synthesize TDP-Fuc4NAc (4-acetamido-4,6-dideoxy-D-galactose) due to Tn10 insertions in the structural gene for the transaminase that catalyzes the conversion of TDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose to TDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-D-galactose (rffA), and (iv) defects in steps subsequent to the synthesis of C55-GlcNAc-ManNAcA-Fuc4NAc (lipid III). In addition, a re-examination of a mutant possessing the rff-726 lesion revealed that it was defective in the synthesis of lipid III due to a defect in the structural gene for the Fuc4NAc transferase (rffT).",1990
s44370,ocular safety and efficacy of an hsv-1 gd vaccine during primary and latent infection.,"ocular safety and efficacy of an hsv-1 gd vaccine during primary and latent infection.. One potential complication of systemic herpes simplex virus (HSV) vaccination is that subsequent ocular infection may lead to increased immunogenic corneal scarring. Therefore, V52, a genetically engineered vaccinia virus that expresses the HSV-1 glycoprotein gD, was tested for ocular safety and for protection against ocular challenge with a stromal-disease-producing strain (McKrae) of HSV-1. To maximize immune response, rabbits were vaccinated by a series of inoculations. V52-vaccinated rabbits developed significant HSV-1 neutralizing antibody titers; however, they were not as high as those induced by vaccination with live HSV-1 McKrae. One month after the final vaccination, all rabbits were challenged ocularly. Eyes were monitored for 35 days for epithelial keratitis, stromal keratitis, and iritis. In no case was epithelial keratitis, stromal keratitis, or iritis significantly exacerbated by vaccination. The gD V52 recombinant vaccine provided protection against HSV-1 induced epithelial keratitis (P = 0.02) and long-term stromal scarring (P = 0.04). There was no significant reduction in the incidence of trigeminal ganglionic latency in the vaccinated rabbits (P greater than 0.05). Thus, our results indicate that V52, a gD recombinant vaccine probably is safe with regard to corneal scarring, and may provide a small amount of protection against ocular HSV-1 infection. The amount of protection provided was less than that reported in mice and guinea pigs. This suggests that to provide high levels of ocular protection in rabbits (and probably in humans), HSV-1 vaccines may have to elicit a more vigorous immune response than that produced by normal HSV-1 infection.",1990
s44512,a fowlpox virus vaccine vector with insertion sites in the terminal repeats: demonstration of its efficacy using the fusion gene of newcastle disease virus.,"a fowlpox virus vaccine vector with insertion sites in the terminal repeats: demonstration of its efficacy using the fusion gene of newcastle disease virus.. In this paper we report the development and testing of a fowlpox virus vector system. Insertion sites in non-essential regions within the terminal inverted repeats of the virus have been characterised. Foreign genes inserted into these sites are shown to be present in two copies in the resultant recombinant virus. To test the potential use of this vector as a live vaccine the fusion gene of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) has been inserted into a vaccine strain of fowlpox virus, and inoculated into chickens. The experiments demonstrate the ability of the recombinant to protect chickens against challenge by a virulent strain of NDV and to elicit the formation of anti-fusion protein antibody.",1990
s44513,"marker vaccines, virus protein-specific antibody assays and the control of aujeszky's disease.","marker vaccines, virus protein-specific antibody assays and the control of aujeszky's disease.. Vaccination of pigs is widely practised to control Aujeszky's disease (AD). Molecular biological research revealed that several conventionally attenuated virus vaccines harbour deletions in their genomes. The deleted genes are nonessential for virus replication and can be involved in the expression of virulence. These findings have prompted several groups to construct well-characterized deletion mutants of AD virus that do not express either glycoprotein gI, gX or gIII. These mutants have also been rendered thymidine kinase negative. Although data on vaccine efficacy and safety have been published, widely varying test conditions have made it impossible to identify the most efficacious deletion mutant vaccine(s). Vaccination enhances the amount of virus required for infection and reduces, but does not prevent, the shedding of virulent virus and the establishment of latency in pigs infected with virulent AD virus. Therefore, while a vaccination programme will reduce the circulation of virus in the field, it will not eliminate AD virus from pig populations. To eradicate AD, the ability to differentiate infected from vaccinated pigs is crucial. The use of marker vaccines enables us to identify infected pigs in vaccinated populations by detecting antibodies against the protein whose gene is deleted from vaccine strains. The antibody response to gI appears to persist for more than 2 years, and all of about 300 field strains tested so far express gI. The use of vaccines lacking gI in combination with an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay to detect antibodies to gI and culling of gI-seropositive pigs, may help to eradicate AD in countries where vaccination is widely practised.",1990
s44588,genetic engineering of the pseudorabies virus genome to construct live vaccines.,"genetic engineering of the pseudorabies virus genome to construct live vaccines.. Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is a herpesvirus of pigs. Homologous recombination with plasmids offers a method to engineer precise changes in the PRV genome to produce advantageous live vaccines. Safety can be ensured by using a non-reverting deletion to inactivate the thymidine kinase gene. One particularly important feature of new PRV vaccines is deletion of an antigen, so that vaccinated pigs are serologically distinguishable from infected pigs. We have constructed a live vaccine strain with deletions in the thymidine kinase gene and in the gene for a glycoprotein, gX. Molecular engineering techniques made it possible to choose deletion of gX, which has no known immunological significance, over deletion of other glycoproteins that contribute to protective immunity. Extensive experiments in pigs with isogenic virus pairs show that deletion of gX does not compromise efficacy of a vaccine as gI deletions do. Deletion of gX also suggests a site for replacement with antigens from other pathogens. In addition to molecular engineering of a live vaccine strain, research on PRV glycoproteins has led to the discovery that expression of the glycoprotein gp50 makes cells resistant to PRV infection. Perhaps this observation could be extrapolated to the level of a whole animal to allow engineering of pigs to become an alternative to engineered vaccines.",1990
s44729,construction of a defective adenovirus vector expressing the pseudorabies virus glycoprotein gp50 and its use as a live vaccine.,"construction of a defective adenovirus vector expressing the pseudorabies virus glycoprotein gp50 and its use as a live vaccine.. The gene encoding the pseudorabies virus glycoprotein gp50 was cloned at the very left end of the genome of adenovirus type 5 to give a recombinant adenovirus (Ad-gp50) defective for the E1A gene. Ad-gp50 expressed high levels of gp50 in cells which either complemented (293 cells) or did not complement (Vero and HeLa cells) the E1A gene. Surprisingly, over an extended period, higher levels of gp50 were produced in HeLa cells which lack the E1A gene. Rabbits and mice inoculated with Ad-gp50 showed a strong antibody response against gp50. Some of them were protected from a virulent challenge with pseudorabies virus.",1990
s45117,evaluation in children of cold-adapted influenza b live attenuated intranasal vaccine prepared by reassortment between wild-type b/ann arbor/1/86 and cold-adapted b/leningrad/14/55 viruses.,"evaluation in children of cold-adapted influenza b live attenuated intranasal vaccine prepared by reassortment between wild-type b/ann arbor/1/86 and cold-adapted b/leningrad/14/55 viruses.. A reassortant cold-adapted (ca) influenza B experimental live attenuated intranasal vaccine was evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in children by means of a blind, placebo controlled study. The vaccine contained the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes, and the gene for its non-structural proteins from wild-type (wt) B/Ann Arbor/1/86 virus, the contemporary strain at the time of the study. Other genes were derived from ca B/Leningrad/14/55 virus. No increase in illness rates was seen in the children from ages 3-15 years given vaccine at maximum potency (a one in two dilution of infectious allantoic fluid, having a titre of 10(7.0) EID50) compared to children given placebo. About 60% of seronegative children, ages 3-7 years, exhibited a detectible antibody response following one dose of intranasal vaccine, with the seroresponse rate rising to greater than 70% after two doses of vaccine. Immunogenicity was lowest in seropositive children age 8-15 years, reaching a maximum of 36% after two doses. Results indicated that the vaccine was highly attenuated, and probably of adequate immunogenicity for kindergarten age children. The lower immunogenicity in older children suggests the vaccine might be overly attenuated for use in school-age children who are more likely to have a history of prior natural infection with influenza B virus. Further clinical and epidemiological studies of protection are needed to fully assess this.",1990

The Mr 63,000 membrane polypeptide (gp63) is one of the Leishmania receptors for host macrophages and has been shown to protect mice from infection. The gene encoding gp63, the major Mr 63,000 surface glycoprotein of L. major promastigotes, has been expressed as a fusion protein with the enzyme glutathione S- transferase encoded by the parasitic helminth Schistosoma japonicum. This fusion protein was recognized by polyclonal antibodies to the native Leishmania gp63 polypeptide. The insoluble gp63 fusion protein was purified by SDS-PAGE and electroelution and was used to raise antibodies in rabbits. These rabbit anti-gp63 antibodies recognized the fusion protein and the denatured parasite gp63 on immunoblots and by immunofluorescence on fixed promastigotes, but did not recognize the native molecule on live organisms. However, antibodies raised against native promastigote glycoproteins, affinity purified on solid-phase gp63 fusion protein, recognized both native and denatured gp63, suggesting the presence of native determinants in the recombinant protein. The gp63 fusion protein did not protect mice of either healer or nonhealer phenotype from challenge infection with live promatigotes. The implications of these results for the engineering of recombinant DNA-produced molecular vaccines are discussed.",1990
s45533,stable expression of foreign antigens from the chromosome of salmonella typhimurium vaccine strains.,"stable expression of foreign antigens from the chromosome of salmonella typhimurium vaccine strains.. A simple and versatile system has been developed using a new cloning vector which can serve as a vehicle for integrating DNA fragments, which direct the expression of heterologous antigens, into the aroC gene on the Salmonella chromosome. The system is based on Escherichia coli plasmid vectors which contain the DNA fragment, cloned from the chromosome of S. typhimurium C5, which encodes the aroC gene. The aroC gene was modified using synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides so that it contained several unique restriction sites into which DNA, directing the expression of heterologous antigens, could be cloned. DNA was integrated into the S. typhimurium chromosome at aroC by transferring the vectors into S. typhimurium polA mutants and allowing homologous recombination to occur between the cloned and chromosomal aroC genes. The vectors were used to integrate nucleotide sequences into the S. typhimurium chromosome which directed the expression of tetanus toxin fragment C and the Treponema pallidum lipoprotein. The expression of both antigens was detected by Western blotting.",1990
s45624,expression of hybrid malaria antigens in insect cells and their engineering for correct folding and secretion.,"expression of hybrid malaria antigens in insect cells and their engineering for correct folding and secretion.. Hybrid proteins containing selected regions of the major surface antigens of the sporozoite and merozoite stages of Plasmodium falciparum were expressed in insect cells using baculovirus vectors. A recombinant protein containing the signal peptide from the precursor to the major merozoite surface antigens (PMMSA) fused to a fragment from the carboxy (C) terminus of the same gene was recognized by monoclonal antibodies specific for reduction-sensitive conformational epitopes within the C-terminal fragment, suggesting that correct disulphide cross-linking of cysteine residues within this region had occurred. Addition of 26 copies of the tetrapeptide repeat from the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) resulted in a protein recognized by anti-CSP antiserum as well as the conformation specific monoclonal antibodies. Deletion of the C-terminal putative anchor sequence from both proteins resulted in secretion of protein in a fully soluble form antigenically indistinguishable from the anchor containing products. Correct conformation was not observed when the proteins were expressed as polyhedrin fusions without the signal peptide. These data indicate that the PMMSA signal peptide is recognized in insect cells and that correct assembly of disulphide cross-links is dependent upon targeting the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum.",1990
s45937,identification and nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding a surface antigen induced by vaccinia virus.,"identification and nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding a surface antigen induced by vaccinia virus.. The gene encoding the specific antigen (S antigen) induced on the surface of vaccinia virus-infected cells was mapped on the viral genome by the construction of recombinant viruses. The S gene is located in the 1.5-kbp XbaI-AccII fragment between 11.1 and 12.6 kbp from the right end of the viral genome. Nucleotide sequencing of the fragment revealed an open reading frame (ORF) of 351 codons capable of producing a polypeptide with a molecular weight (MW) of 40,701 Da. Mapping of the S mRNA by primer extension indicates the presence of the transcription initiation site that precedes the translation initiation codon by 14 nucleotides. The region preceding the S mRNA start site is extremely A/T-rich and has sequence similarity with other early genes. The signal for termination of transcription of the early genes, TTTTTAT, is included near the end of the ORF. The deduced amino acid sequence contains a typical membrane signal characterized by a hydrophobic region in the N-terminus. An early polypeptide with a MW of 40 kDa, in agreement with the size predicted from the ORF, was synthesized by cell-free translation of the mRNA selected by hybridization to a plasmid containing the region of the ORF.",1990
s45966,expression of influenza a and b virus nucleoprotein antigens in baculovirus.,"expression of influenza a and b virus nucleoprotein antigens in baculovirus.. Full-length cDNA clones of the nucleoprotein (NP) genes of influenza A/Ann Arbor/6/60 and B/Ann Arbor/1/86 viruses were constructed from virion RNA and subsequently expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells using the baculovirus vector, Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus. Western blot analysis of lysates prepared from Sf9 cells infected with the recombinant viruses confirmed that the baculovirus-expressed NP antigens were reactive with monoclonal antibodies specific for either type A or B NP and with anti-NP antibodies in human serum samples. Electrophoretic analysis indicated that the expressed NP antigens comigrated with NP purified from influenza A or B virions and that the recombinant NP antigens represented greater than 10% of total protein in infected cells. Dilutions of clarified Sf9 cell lysates were used as antigens in a standard enzyme immunoassay to detect serum antibody specific for influenza A or B viruses. The results from assays using the baculovirus-expressed NP antigens showed good correlation with the results obtained using bacterially expressed NP antigen as well as complement fixation. Therefore, baculovirus-expressed NP antigens have the potential to be used to develop reproducible and routine assays for the serodiagnosis of influenza virus infections as an alternative to the complement fixation or haemagglutination inhibition tests.",1990
s46045,poxvirus recombinant vaccines.,"poxvirus recombinant vaccines.. The poxvirus family, subfamily Chordopoxviridae, contains six genera. The basic criteria distinguishing membership in a genus is cross-neutralization and host-range predilection. Members of the genus Orthopoxvirus (vaccinia) and of the genus Avipoxvirus (fowlpox) have been genetically engineered to express genes from heterologous pathogens, thus providing a means of assessing these recombinant viruses as live recombinant vaccines. Vaccinia virus recombinants which have a broad host range can be useful vectors for both human and veterinary applications, while fowlpox virus recombinants, with a host range restricted to avian species, provide useful vectors for application to poultry diseases. Significantly, avipoxviruses have also been shown to be useful as vaccinating vectors in non-avian species. The results presented in this paper were selected to provide the reader with a sense of the extensive potential present in recombinant poxviruses as live recombinant vaccine candidates. The broad host range of vaccinia vectors and the narrower host range of avipoxvirus provide interesting applications. The surprising results obtained in non-avian species with recombinant fowlpox viruses are quite intriguing. The ability to generate a recombinant live vaccine that can readily be amplified in tissue culture, yet is non-proliferative in vivo, provides unique properties and interesting potential applications.",1990
s46813,"processing, assembly, and immunogenicity of human immunodeficiency virus core antigens expressed by recombinant vaccinia virus.","processing, assembly, and immunogenicity of human immunodeficiency virus core antigens expressed by recombinant vaccinia virus.. Recombinant vaccinia viruses that contained regions of the gag-pol open reading frames of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were constructed. Cells infected with recombinants containing both gag and protease genes expressed and processed HIV gag antigens efficiently. Processing was much reduced in cells infected with recombinants containing only gag, but not the protease gene. However, significant amounts of p41 were produced by protease-defective recombinants. This protein was immunoreactive with p24-specific monoclonal antibodies and was produced in a truncated form by a recombinant containing a 3' deletion in the p15 coding region of gag ORF. These results indicate that p41 could represent an alternative gag precursor with N-terminal sequences derived from p24 and C-terminal from p15. Ultrastructural analysis of recombinant-infected cells revealed that the gag antigens expressed were assembled into retrovirus-like particles and were secreted into culture medium. This assembly process was not dependent on HIV protease function, because immature core particles were produced by recombinants lacking HIV-1 protease functions. Immunization of mice and chimpanzees with vaccinia-HIVgag recombinant viruses generated both antibody and cell-mediated immune responses to HIV gag antigens. These recombinants are therefore useful not only for studying HIV virion processing and assembly, but also for designing immunogens for the prophylaxis and immunotherapy against AIDS.",1990

The asd mutants of Salmonella typhimurium have an obligate requirement for diaminopimelic acid (DAP) and will undergo lysis in environments deprived of DAP. This has allowed the development of a balanced-lethal system for the expression of heterologous antigens in vaccine strains using vectors containing the wild-type asd gene from Streptococcus mutans and asd mutant Salmonella hosts [Nakayama et al., Biotechnology 6 (1988) 693-697]. We have cloned the asd gene from S. typhimurium, characterized the gene product and used this gene to construct Asd+ expression cloning vectors. In addition we have constructed an asd cassette and a transposon derived from Tn5 that allow the rapid modification of other vectors for use with delta asd vaccine strains of S. typhimurium adding versatility to the Asd+ vector/delta asd host system of plasmid maintenance.",1990
s47005,engineering of genetically detoxified pertussis toxin analogs for development of a recombinant whooping cough vaccine.,"engineering of genetically detoxified pertussis toxin analogs for development of a recombinant whooping cough vaccine.. Pertussis toxin (PT) is an important protective antigen in vaccines against whooping cough, and a genetically detoxified PT analog is the preferred form of the immunogen. Several amino acids of the S1 subunit were identified as functionally critical residues by site-directed mutagenesis, specifically, those at positions 9, 13, 26, 35, 41, 58, and 129. Eighty-three mutated PT operons were introduced into Bordetella parapertussis, and the resultant toxin analogs were screened for expression levels, enzymatic activity, residual toxicity, and antigenicity. While more than half of the mutants were found to be poorly secreted or assembled, the rest were fully assembled and most were highly detoxified. Single mutations resulted in up to a 1,000-fold reduction in both toxic and enzymatic activities, while PT analogs with multiple mutations (Lys-9 Gly-129, Glu-58 Gly-129, and Lys-9 Glu-58 Gly-129) were 10(6)-fold detoxified. Operons coding for stable and nontoxic mutants shown to express a critical immunodominant protective epitope were returned to the chromosome of Bordetella pertussis by allelic exchange. In vivo analysis of the toxin analogs showed a dramatic reduction in histamine sensitization and lymphocytosis-promoting activities, paralleling the reduction in toxic activities. All mutants were protective in an intracerebral challenge test, and the Lys-9 Gly-129 analog was found to be significantly more immunogenic than the toxoid. PT analogs such as those described represent suitable components for the design of a recombinant whooping cough vaccine.",1990

Four oligopeptides corresponding to predicted antigenic regions of the protective Bm86 glycoprotein of the cattle tick Boophilus microplus were synthesized and purified. Three were conjugated to carrier proteins and antisera raised in rabbits and cows. All elicited antipeptide antibodies that recognized Bm86 and recombinant derived products in Western blots; however, only one produced antiserum capable of recognizing native Bm86 in an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Ticks fed in vitro on this antiserum showed no obvious gut damage.",1990
s47066,occurrence of secondary attenuating mutations in avirulent salmonella typhimurium vaccine strains.,"occurrence of secondary attenuating mutations in avirulent salmonella typhimurium vaccine strains.. The attenuating delta aroA554 mutation in Salmonella typhimurium strain SL3261 was complemented in vitro by selecting for AroA+ recombinant DNA clones. SL3261 containing cloned aroA+ genes did not require exogenous phenylalanine, tryptophan, tryosine, p-aminobenzoic acid, or dihydroxybenzoic acid for growth in defined media. Cloned aroA+ genes did not restore wild-type virulence to SL3261, however, in a murine typhoid model. The delta aroA554 mutation was transduced into S. typhimurium strain SR-11, a mouse-virulent strain recently passaged in mice. The SR-11 delta aroA554 mutant was highly attenuated for mice challenged parenterally. The same cloned aroA+ genes isolated in SL3261 restored the virulence of the SR-11 delta aroA554 mutant to that of wild-type SR-11. These results suggest that while the delta aroA554 allele remains effective in reducing S. typhimurium virulence, laboratory passage of attenuated vaccine strains may lead to the accumulation of additional attenuating defects.",1990

The DNA sequences of a cDNA clone and the macronuclear genomic fragment corresponding to the functional copy of the SerH3 surface antigen gene of Tetrahymena thermophila were determined. Primer extension and nuclease protection assays show that the SerH3 transcription unit is 1,425 nucleotides long and contains no introns. The predicted polypeptide encoded by the SerH3 gene has a molecular mass of 44,415 daltons; one-third of its 439 residues are either cysteine, serine, or threonine. The central half of the polypeptide consists of three homologous domains in tandem array; within these domains, the cysteine, proline, and tryptophan residues occur in highly regular patterns.",1990

Yersinia pestis produces a glycoprotein capsule, the biosynthesis of which appears to be temperature dependent. The fraction I (F1) component of this capsule is specific to Y. pestis and the detection of F1 antibodies is the basis for several serological tests. We report the cloning of the F1 gene and its expression in Escherichia coli using the phagemid vector lambda ZAPII and a F1-specific monoclonal antibody. The recombinant F1 antigen had a molecular weight of 17 kDa, which proved to be identical to that of the F1 antigen produced by Y. pestis. The recombinant cells produced F1 antigen at 37 degrees C but only minimal amounts at 27 degrees C, suggesting that the genetic features affected by temperature in Y. pestis may be operating in the E. coli clone. It is not known if their similar molecular weights reflect the glycosylated nature of both proteins. F1 antigen purified from the E. coli recombinant induced a protective immune response in BALB/c mice challenged with up to 10(5) virulent Y. pestis. The resistance of immunized mice to plague infection correlated with high titers of F1 antibody. The cloned gene expresses an immunogenically competent F1 antigen suitable for use in plague serodiagnostics and vaccine development.",1990

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules export peptides to the cell surface for surveillance by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Intracellular peptide binding is critical for the proper assembly and transport of class I molecules. This mechanism is impaired as a result of a non-functional peptide supply factor gene (PSF) in several human mutant cell lines with genomic lesions in the MHC. We have now identified PSF in the MHC class II region by deletion mapping in mutants and chromosome-walking. PSF is homologous to mammalian and bacterial ATP-dependent transport proteins, suggesting that it operates in the intracellular transport of peptides.",1990
s47947,construction of an auxotrophic shigella flexneri strain for use as a live vaccine.,"construction of an auxotrophic shigella flexneri strain for use as a live vaccine.. A virulent Shigella flexneri serotype Y strain, SFL1, was made auxotrophic for aromatic metabolites, including p-aminobenzoic acid, which is not available in mammalian tissues, by transduction of a Tn10-inactivated aroD gene from Escherichia coli K-12 NK5131. One transductant, SFL114, selected for further studies, had the same biochemical and serological characteristics as the parent strain and the O-antigen patterns of the two strains were identical in SDS-PAGE and Western blot experiments. SFL114 was as invasive for cultured epithelial cells as SFL1, and both strains could escape from the phagocytic vacuole into the cytoplasm of the infected cells. However, the ability of SFL114 to multiply intracellularly was considerably reduced. When applied to the conjunctival sac of guinea pigs, the parent strain gave rise to keratoconjunctivitis, i.e. was Sereny-positive, in 13 of 16 animals. By contrast, SFL114 was Sereny-negative in all 11 guinea pigs tested. These in vitro and in vivo results suggest that the aromatic-dependent transductant S. flexneri SFL114 is attenuated and possesses properties desirable for a live vaccine.",1990
s48043,transport protein genes in the murine mhc: possible implications for antigen processing.,"transport protein genes in the murine mhc: possible implications for antigen processing.. T lymphocyte activation requires recognition by the T cell of peptide fragments of foreign antigen bound to a self major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. Genetic evidence suggests that part of the class II region of the MHC influences the expression, in trans, of MHC class I antigens on the cell surface, by regulating the availability of peptides that bind to and stabilize the class I molecule. Two closely related genes in this region, HAM1 and HAM2, were cloned and had sequence similarities to a superfamily of genes involved in the ATP-dependent transport of a variety of substrates across cell membranes. Thus, these MHC-linked transport protein genes may be involved in transporting antigen, or peptide fragments thereof, from the cytoplasm into a membrane-bounded compartment containing newly synthesized MHC molecules.",1990
s48114,the two open reading frames of the 22k mrna of human respiratory syncytial virus: sequence comparison of antigenic subgroups a and b and expression in vitro.,"the two open reading frames of the 22k mrna of human respiratory syncytial virus: sequence comparison of antigenic subgroups a and b and expression in vitro.. The sequence of the 22K mRNA of strain 18537 of antigenic subgroup B of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was determined by sequencing cloned cDNAs of intracellular mRNA. Comparison with the corresponding sequence of the A2 strain of subgroup A showed that there is 78% nucleotide sequence identity overall, that the amino acid sequence of the 22K protein is 92% identical between subgroups and that the 22K mRNA of both subgroups contains a second, internal, overlapping open reading frame (ORF) whose length, nucleotide sequence and potential translational start and stop sites were highly conserved and whose predicted product has 62% amino acid identity between subgroups. Sequence analysis of 36 cDNAs of intracellular 22K mRNA of strain A2 did not detect nucleotide insertions or deletions in the region of overlap between the two ORFs, indicating that the majority of intracellular 22K mRNA is a faithful copy containing the two distinct ORFs. Translation in vitro of mRNAs transcribed from engineered cDNAs showed that an mRNA which contained only the second, internal ORF directed the synthesis of a previously unidentified polypeptide of the predicted size, whereas mRNA representing the complete gene directed the synthesis of both the 22K protein and the product of the internal ORF. This latter species was synthesized in vitro as a discrete, separate protein rather than as a fusion protein. It is not yet known whether this protein is synthesized in RSV-infected cells.",1990
s48301,characterization of the genomic organization of human carcinoembryonic antigen (cea): comparison with other family members and sequence analysis of 5' controlling region.,characterization of the genomic organization of human carcinoembryonic antigen (cea): comparison with other family members and sequence analysis of 5' controlling region.. A cosmid containing the entire coding region for human carcinoembryonic antigen has been isolated. Detailed analysis and sequencing have determined an organization comprising nine exons encoding amino acids and one for a 3' untranslated fragment. Comparison with other family members reveals a complex pattern of homology at the 3' end of the gene. The 5' noncoding region is rich in purine-rich motifs and possible enhancer elements and has a region with properties similar to those of HTF islands.,1990
s48337,"cloning, expression, and cdna sequence of surface antigen p22 from toxoplasma gondii.","cloning, expression, and cdna sequence of surface antigen p22 from toxoplasma gondii.. Immunoblot, immunofluorescence, and complement-mediated cytolytic assays revealed that two new monoclonal antibodies raised against a membrane-enriched fraction of Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites recognize protein P22 on the surface of the parasite. Using these monoclonal antibodies to screen a cDNA expression library in lambda gt11, several clones expressing recombinant fusion proteins were isolated. Subsequent screening of the library with a synthetic oligonucleotide derived from the 5' end of one of these cDNAs permitted the isolation of additional nonexpressing clones containing the entire translated sequence. Blots of parasite RNA and DNA suggested that the corresponding gene occurs as a single copy in the tachyzoite genome. The amino acid sequence deduced from the composite cDNA indicates a primary translation product with a theoretical molecular weight of 18,959. As expected for surface protein P22, the putative polypeptide contains a predicted N-terminal signal sequence and a C-terminal hydrophobic region characteristic of proteins attached to the membrane by a glycophospholipid anchor. Recombinant fusion proteins produced by the expressing clones were recognized on immunoblots by IgG antibodies in the sera of humans with acute and chronic T. gondii infection. Antibodies selected by the fusion protein reacted predominantly with a 22-kDa antigen on immunoblots of parasite lysate.",1990
s48469,cross-antigenicity between the major surface proteins (ospa and ospb) and other proteins of borrelia burgdorferi.,"cross-antigenicity between the major surface proteins (ospa and ospb) and other proteins of borrelia burgdorferi.. Two of the major surface Ag of Borrelia burgdorferi, the 31-kDa OspA and 34-kDa OspB proteins, are encoded by a 49-kb plasmid. In this study, mAb and monospecific polyclonal antibodies were used to define cross-antigenicity of the OspA and OspB protein to each other and to other lower molecular mass proteins by Western blot analysis. Two mAb studied, 105.5 and 184.1, were directed predominantly against the 31-kDa OspA protein. However, each also reacted with other minor bands, though with different specificities. Using V8 protease digestion and cleavage by cyanogen bromide, we demonstrated that each mAb reacted to the 31-kDa protein differently. Monospecific polyclonal rabbit and human antibodies directed against the 34-, 31-, 22-, and 20-kDa proteins were eluted from blots and used to further corroborate the cross-reactivity among these Ag. Rabbit antibodies to the 31- and 22-kDa Ag gave remarkably similar peptide maps after V8 protease digestion of the 31-kDa OspA protein, as did mAb 184.1, suggesting that this mAb recognized an immunodominant epitope common to the 22- and 31-kDa proteins. It seems likely therefore that the humoral immune response to Borrelia surface Ag may be due to a limited number of cross-reactive epitopes on distinct, but related, gene products.",1990
s48478,a recombinant human adenovirus vaccine against rabies.,"a recombinant human adenovirus vaccine against rabies.. Rabies continues to be a serious problem in both developed and developing nations due to the reservoir of rabies virus in wildlife vectors. The control and worldwide eradication of rabies depends on the development of safe, effective, and economical vaccines that might be used in preexposure vaccination programs for humans and animals. To this end an infectious human adenovirus type 5 recombinant virus that contains the rabies glycoprotein gene, and which may serve as the prototype for a new class of vaccines against rabies, was constructed and tested. This recombinant, when administered by either the parenteral or oronasal route, was highly effective in eliciting good levels of rabies-neutralizing antibodies in the sera of dogs and mice. Mice immunized by the recombinant virus were protected from lethal intracerebral challenge with rabies virus.",1990
s48738,molecular components of the b-cell antigen receptor complex of the igm class.,"molecular components of the b-cell antigen receptor complex of the igm class.. The antigen receptors on mature B lymphocytes are membrane-bound immunoglobulins of the IgM and IgD classes whose cross-linking by polyvalent antigens results in B-cell proliferation and differentiation. How these membrane-bound immunoglobulin chains, which lack a cytoplasmic tail, generate a cell activation signal is not at present known. We now show that the IgM molecule is non-covalently associated in the membrane of B cells with two proteins of relative molecular mass 34,000 (Mr 34 K; IgM-alpha) and 39 K (Ig-beta) which form a disulphide-linked heterodimer. Surface expression of IgM seems to require the formation of an appropriate complex between IgM and the heterodimer. A transfection experiment indicates that IgM-alpha is the product of mb-1, a B-cell specific gene encoding a transmembrane protein with sequence homology to proteins of the T-cell antigen receptor-CD3 complex.",1990
s48938,mouse-human chimeric monoclonal antibody to carcinoembryonic antigen (cea): in vitro and in vivo activities.,"mouse-human chimeric monoclonal antibody to carcinoembryonic antigen (cea): in vitro and in vivo activities.. Mouse-human chimeric antibody specific for human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was produced by recombinant DNA techniques. The genes of the mouse variable regions of heavy and light chains were cloned from the mouse hybridoma, 2.7.1G.10., which secreted anti human CEA antibody (IgG1, kappa), and were joined with human gamma 1 and kappa constant genes. The affinity of the resultant chimeric antibody to its relevant antigen was the same as that of the parental mouse monoclonal antibody when analysed by Scatchard plot analysis. The chimeric antibody showed a potent antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells against CEA-positive human adenocarcinoma cells. In vivo imaging analysis revealed that the present chimeric antibody was specifically localized on the tumor site. These results indicate that our mouse-human chimeric antibody is a promising reagent for the diagnosis and therapy of CEA-positive human cancers.",1990

To address potential concerns over the release of genetically engineered live bacterial vaccines, we constructed a recombination-deficient derivative of the Vibrio cholerae O1 vaccine strain CVD103 (CVD103RM). Oral immunization of adult volunteers with CVD103RM showed that the recA mutation significantly diminished colonization ability and immunogenicity of the vaccine strain.",1990

A cold-adapted (ca) influenza B reassortant that derived two genes encoding the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase from influenza B/Ann Arbor/1/86 wild-type virus and six internal RNA segments from ca influenza B/Ann Arbor/1/66 virus was evaluated in 66 adult volunteers having a serum hemagglutination inhibition antibody titer less than or equal to 1:8. The ca reassortant was attenuated and elicited the production of systemic and local antibodies; the 50% human infectious dose was 10(6.4) TCID50. Six weeks after vaccination, 12 unvaccinated volunteers and 13 recipients of ca virus (10(7.5) TCID50) were challenged experimentally with homologous wild-type influenza B virus. The ca vaccine completely protected against illness, and the magnitude of shedding was 50-fold less in vaccinees than in unimmunized controls, five of whom became ill. These findings indicate that the six internal RNA segments of the ca influenza B/Ann Arbor/66 donor virus confer desirable properties of a live virus vaccine to a reassortant derived from a virulent virus. Such reassortants may be suitable vaccines for healthy adults.",1990
s49250,the melanoma antigen gp75 is the human homologue of the mouse b (brown) locus gene product.,"the melanoma antigen gp75 is the human homologue of the mouse b (brown) locus gene product.. The gp75 antigen is an abundant intracellular glycoprotein expressed in melanosomes of human pigmented melanocytes and melanomas. IgG antibodies in sera of a patient with metastatic melanoma have been shown to immunoprecipitate gp75, suggesting that immunological tolerance against gp75 can be broken. The mouse mAb TA99, which specifically recognizes gp75, was used to isolate and purify the antigen. Amino acid sequences of three internal peptides were determined from the purified gp75 polypeptide. cDNA clones were isolated by screening with oligonucleotides based on these peptide sequences. The gp75 peptides and cDNA had approximately 90% identity with, respectively, the derived amino acid and nucleotide sequences of a mouse gene that maps to the b (brown) locus. The brown locus determines coat color in the mouse, suggesting that gp75 regulates or influences the type of melanin synthesized.",1990
s49446,molecular cloning of cdna for the carcinoma-associated antigen ga733-2.,"molecular cloning of cdna for the carcinoma-associated antigen ga733-2.. Defined by monoclonal antibody GA733, the GA733-2 antigen is a cell surface 40-kDa glycoprotein associated with human carcinomas of various origins. Molecular clones for the GA733-2 antigen were isolated from a colorectal carcinoma cell line cDNA library using the high-efficiency COS cell expression system. A 1.4-kilobase cDNA species was enriched by immunoselection with monoclonal antibody. The authenticity of individual clones was established by immunologic and sequence criteria. At the amino acid sequence level, GA733-2 was found to be greater than 99% identical to the previously described KSA antigen defined by monoclonal antibody KS1/4. The amino acid sequence derived from the previously described GA733-related gene, GA733-1, was found to be 49% identical to GA733-2. The positions of 12 cysteine residues in the extracellular domains of the two GA733 antigens are conserved, as is the overall distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues. A 1.45-kilobase transcript of the GA733-2/KSA gene was found to be expressed in cell lines derived from colorectal and pancreatic carcinoma.",1990
s49692,cloning of the complete gene for carcinoembryonic antigen: analysis of its promoter indicates a region conveying cell type-specific expression.,"cloning of the complete gene for carcinoembryonic antigen: analysis of its promoter indicates a region conveying cell type-specific expression.. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a widely used tumor marker, especially in the surveillance of colonic cancer patients. Although CEA is also present in some normal tissues, it is apparently expressed at higher levels in tumorous tissues than in corresponding normal tissues. As a first step toward analyzing the regulation of expression of CEA at the transcriptional level, we have isolated and characterized a cosmid clone (cosCEA1), which contains the entire coding region of the CEA gene. A close correlation exists between the exon and deduced immunoglobulin-like domain borders. We have determined a cluster of transcriptional starts for CEA and the closely related nonspecific cross-reacting antigen (NCA) gene and have sequenced their putative promoters. Regions of sequence homology are found as far as approximately 500 nucleotides upstream from the translational starts of these genes, but farther upstream they diverge completely. In both cases we were unable to find classic TATA or CAAT boxes at their expected positions. To characterize the CEA and NCA promoters, we carried out transient transfection assays with promoter-indicator gene constructs in the CEA-producing adenocarcinoma cell line SW403, as well as in nonproducing HeLa cells. A CEA gene promoter construct, containing approximately 400 nucleotides upstream from the translational start, showed nine times higher activity in the SW403 than in the HeLa cell line. This indicates that cis-acting sequences which convey cell type-specific expression of the CEA gene are contained within this region.",1990
s49703,presentation of viral antigen controlled by a gene in the major histocompatibility complex.,"presentation of viral antigen controlled by a gene in the major histocompatibility complex.. We describe a mutant human cell line (LBL 721.174) that has lost a function required for presentation of intracellular viral antigens with class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), but retains the capacity to present defined epitopes as extracellular peptides. The cell also has a defect in the assembly and expression of class I MHC molecules, which we show can be restored by exposure of the cells to a peptide epitope. This phenotype suggests a defect in the association of intracellular antigen with class I molecules similar to that described for the murine mutant RMA-S (ref. 5), but in the present case the genetic defect can be mapped within the MHC locus on human chromosome 6.",1990

The Ro/SS-A (Ro) autoantigens consist of at least four immunologically distinct proteins which are recognized by autoantibodies typically found in sera from patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome and in subsets of patients with lupus erythematosus. We recently isolated a 1.9-kb human cDNA clone which encodes one of these Ro autoantigens. Synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to the human Ro sequence were used to amplify the homologous gene from a murine B cell cDNA library using the polymerase chain reaction. The mouse cDNA-encoded amino acid sequence was found to be 94% homologous to the human Ro sequence and is 100% homologous to murine calreticulin, a high affinity calcium-binding protein which resides in the endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum. The amino acid sequence of rabbit calreticulin is 92% homologous to both murine calreticulin and human Ro. Onchocerca volvulus and Drosophila melanogaster also have molecules that are highly homologous to human Ro. In addition, human Ro has a molecular mass, isoelectric point, and significant amino acid sequence similar to the Aplysia californica snail neuronal protein 407. These homologies suggest that this Ro protein has a very basic cellular function(s) which may in part involve calcium binding.",1990
s50206,murine antibody response to oral infection with live aroa recombinant salmonella dublin vaccine strains expressing filamentous hemagglutinin antigen from bordetella pertussis.,"murine antibody response to oral infection with live aroa recombinant salmonella dublin vaccine strains expressing filamentous hemagglutinin antigen from bordetella pertussis.. Two plasmids which express either nearly intact or truncated filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) from Bordetella pertussis and which are marked with a tetracycline resistance (Tcr) gene were transformed into Salmonella dublin SL1438, an aroA deletion mutant intended for use as an attenuated oral vaccine against salmonellosis. These S. dublin recombinants, when fed to mice, induced serum immunoglobulin, immunoglobulin M (IgM), and sometimes IgA antibody responses to FHA and S. dublin. In addition, IgA antibodies against FHA were found in gut wash fluids. S. dublin carrying pDB2300, a multicopy plasmid encoding truncated FHA protein, induced a better antibody response than did S. dublin carrying pDB2000, a low-copy-number plasmid encoding full-sized FHA. Administration of tetracycline to mice enhanced the stability of recombinant plasmids, and tetracycline-treated mice developed higher anti-FHA titers. Although neither strain examined is suitable for use in a human oral vaccine, these data demonstrated that an immune response against B. pertussis FHA could be induced by oral administration of live attenuated recombinant strains of S. dublin and suggested that development of a live oral attenuated vaccine against pertussis may be possible.",1990
s50245,adenovirus vaccine vectors expressing hepatitis b surface antigen: importance of regulatory elements in the adenovirus major late intron.,"adenovirus vaccine vectors expressing hepatitis b surface antigen: importance of regulatory elements in the adenovirus major late intron.. Adenovirus types 4 and 7 are currently used as live oral vaccines for prevention of acute respiratory disease caused by these adenovirus serotypes. To investigate the concept of producing live recombinant vaccines using these serotypes, adenovirus types 4 (Ad4) and 7 (Ad7) were constructed that produce HBsAg upon infection of cell cultures. Ad4 recombinants were constructed that express HBsAg from a cassette inserted 135 bp from the right-hand terminus of the viral genome. The cassette contained the Ad4 major late promoter followed by leader 1 of the tripartite leader, the first intervening sequence between leaders 1 and 2, leaders 2 and 3, the HBsAg gene, and tandem polyadenylation signals from the Ad4 E3B and hexon genes. Using this same cassette, a series of Ad4 recombinants expressing HBsAg were constructed with deletions in the intervening sequence between leaders 1 and 2 to evaluate the contribution of the downstream control elements more precisely. Inclusion of regions located between +82 and +148 as well as +148 and +232 resulted in increases in expression levels of HBsAg in A549-infected cells by 22-fold and 44-fold, respectively, over the levels attained by an adenovirus recombinant retaining only sequences from +1 to +82, showing the importance of these elements in the activation of the major late promoter during the course of a natural Ad4 viral infection. Parallel increases were also observed in steady-state levels of cytoplasmic HBsAg-specific mRNA. When similar Ad7 recombinant viruses were constructed, these viruses also expressed 20-fold more HBsAg due to the presence of the intron. All Ad4 and Ad7 recombinants produced HBsAg particles containing gp27 and p24 which were secreted in the medium. When dogs were immunized intratracheally with one of these Ad7 recombinants, they seroconverted to both Ad7 and HBsAg to a high level.",1990
s50405,human homologue of murine tumor rejection antigen gp96: 5'-regulatory and coding regions and relationship to stress-induced proteins.,"human homologue of murine tumor rejection antigen gp96: 5'-regulatory and coding regions and relationship to stress-induced proteins.. Cell-surface glycoproteins of 96 kDa (gp96) have been implicated in immunogenicity of methylcholanthrene-induced mouse sarcomas in syngeneic hosts. In view of the potential immunogenicity of gp96-related molecules in human tumors, we have defined the 5'-regulatory and complete coding regions of a human gp96 transcript. The 5'-regulatory region contains an imperfect heat shock element apart from other regulatory sequences. The amino acid sequence of human gp96 is 96% homologous to its murine counterpart and genes for the two molecules show significant homology between untranslated regions. Comparison of gp96 sequences to other sequences in DNA and protein data bases indicates significant homology with the stress proteins 94-kDa glucose-regulated protein (grp94) and 108-kDa heat shock protein (hsp108) and 99-kDa endoplasmic reticular protein (ERp99). These molecules are either identical or represent a family of closely related molecules. With regard to their role in tumor immunity, it needs to be determined whether gp96 molecules are tumor antigens per se or whether they serve as carriers of other immunogenic moieties.",1990

The genome of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is highly heterogeneous. Some of this genomic variability is reflected in the biologic and serologic differences observed among various strains of HIV-1. To map the viral determinants that correlate with pathogenicity of the virus, recombinant viruses were generated between biologically active molecular clones of HIV-1 strains that show differences in T-cell or macrophage tropism, cytopathogenicity, CD4 antigen modulation, and susceptibility to serum neutralization. The results of these studies indicate that the envelope region contains the major determinants of these viral features. Further studies with sequence exchanges within this region should help identify specific domains that contribute to HIV pathogenesis.",1990

Mice of a transgenic mouse lineage 501, produced by zygotic injection of the parotid alpha-amylase promoter-SV40 T-antigen hybrid gene, developed osteosarcomas at about 15 months of age. The tumors predominantly involved the axial skeleton, were sometimes multiple, and metastasized to the liver. A cell line derived from a primary tumor produced osteosarcomas on transfer to nude mice. The 501 transgenic lineage thus provides a valuable new model for studying the histogenesis of osteosarcomas.",1990
s50804,is a function of the secreted hepatitis b e antigen to induce immunologic tolerance in utero?,"is a function of the secreted hepatitis b e antigen to induce immunologic tolerance in utero?. Infants born to hepatitis B virus carrier mothers, who express a secreted form of the nucleocapsid antigen designated HBeAg, invariably become persistently infected. To investigate the role of immunologic tolerance mechanisms in chronic infection of the newborn, we have generated HBeAg-expressing transgenic mice. HBeAg-expressing transgenic mice were tolerant to both HBeAg and the nonsecreted nucleocapsid (hepatitis B cor antigen/HBcAg) at the T-cell level. Transgenic mice did not produce antibody to HBeAg but did produce anti-HBc antibody in vivo and in vitro. The coexistence of tolerance to HBc/HBe T-cell determinants and anti-HBc antibody production in vivo parallels the immunologic status of neonates born to carrier mothers. It was also demonstrated that the maintenance of T-cell tolerance to HBcAg/HBeAg required the continued presence of the tolerogen and in its absence persisted for less than 16 weeks. The reversibility of T-cell tolerance to HBcAg/HBeAg may explain the inverse correlation between age of infection and rates of viral persistence. These observations suggest that a function of the HBeAg may be to induce immunologic tolerance in utero. Expression of HBeAg may represent a viral strategy to guarantee persistence after perinatal infection.",1990

The gene for the extracellular alpha antigen of Mycobacterium kansasii was cloned by using the alpha-antigen gene fragments of M. bovis BCG as probes. Gene analysis revealed that this gene encodes 325 amino acid residues, including 40 amino acids for the signal peptide, followed by 285 amino acids for the mature protein. A comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the genes isolated from these two mycobacterial species showed that the levels of DNA and amino acid homology were 84.8 and 89.1%, respectively. The hydropathy profiles were also compared, and two highly changed hydrophilic regions were observed, which might account for the antigenic diversity of this antigen or its acquirement of antigenic specificity.",1990
s51201,poxvirus-based vectors as vaccine candidates.,"poxvirus-based vectors as vaccine candidates.. The advent of recombinant DNA techniques and advances in immunology have provided a means for dissecting the immunobiology of disease-causing agents. Identification and expression of individual genes from the pathogens in heterologous systems, such as VV, have yielded valuable information regarding structural properties of the gene products and their role in eliciting protective immunity. Targets of both humoral and/or cellular immunity for many disease-causing agents have been identified or confirmed using a VV expression system (Section IV). Additionally, specific VV recombinants have induced a protective immune response in experimental animals. The ability of VV recombinants to induce pertinent immune responses necessary for protection, the potential to develop polyvalent vaccines, and the successful history of VV as an immunizing agent provide the impetus for engineering VV as a live recombinant vaccine candidate. Critical to the refinement of poxviruses as recombinant immunizing agents is a more in-depth knowledge of the molecular biology of these viruses. Although significant advances have been made in this area within the past 10 years, a greater understanding of the mechanisms governing gene expression and viral virulence factors should enable the development of more safe and effective vaccine candidates. Progression of VV vector technology to other members of the poxvirus family has been successful. Development of other poxviruses as vectors may, therefore, provide a means of generating host-restricted vaccines. Fowlpox recombinant viruses, for instance, may yield candidate vaccines in the poultry industry. Interestingly, it was also demonstrated that these host-restricted recombinant viruses can be used as immunizing vehicles in other species. The ability of a nonreplicating viral vector to elicit a protective immune response is especially intriguing in light of the observation by Morgan et al. that a VV/EBV gp340/220 recombinant, derived from an avirulent VV strain, was unable to protect cottontop tamarins from a live EBV challenge.",1990
s51266,enhanced immunogenicity of the pre-s region of hepatitis b surface antigen.,"enhanced immunogenicity of the pre-s region of hepatitis b surface antigen.. The 55 codons upstream of the gene sequence encoding the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) are called the pre-S(2) region. It has been proposed that polypeptides of high molecular weight that contain the pre-S(2) region should be included in future hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccines. The pre-S(2) region and the S gene product [25 kilodalton (kD)] together compose a polypeptide of high molecular weight (33 kD). As an initial attempt to determine the relevance of the 33-kD polypeptide to development of an HBV vaccine, the murine immune response to pre-S(2)-encoded determinants as compared to S-encoded determinants on the same polypeptide was examined. The results indicate (i) the pre-S(2) region is significantly more immunogenic than the S region of HBsAg, (ii) the 26 amino acid residues at the NH2-terminus of the 33-kD polypeptide represent a dominant antibody binding site on the pre-S(2) region, (iii) the immune response to the pre-S(2) region is regulated by H-2-linked genes distinct from those that regulate the response to the S region, and (iv) immunization of an S region nonresponder strain with HBV envelope particles that contain both the pre-S(2) and S regions can circumvent nonresponsiveness to the S region.",1985

A genomic expression library of P.falciparum has been differentially screened with a number of immune sera. The response of 9 clones to the various sera is presented, together with the DNA sequence encoding the epitopes. All but one clone are extremely A+T rich and unlike the other P.falciparum epitopes described, are not composed of amino acid repeats. One clone, which responds specifically with a protective serum, has been analysed in detail. The epitope is carried on a 160kd antigen which is transcribed from a single gene to give a protein expressed in all of the erythrocytic forms. DNA sequence of this clone reveals it to have more than one open reading frame, only one of which is transcribed in the blood stages. The possible significance of the other open readings frames is discussed.",1985
s51323,"current status and strategies for vaccines against diseases induced by human t-cell lymphotropic retroviruses (htlv-i, -ii, -iii).","current status and strategies for vaccines against diseases induced by human t-cell lymphotropic retroviruses (htlv-i, -ii, -iii).. The continuous increase in the number of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases for whom no effective therapy is currently possible mandates attempts at developing primary prevention by a vaccine. Two basic unknowns are considered important: the identification of virus-exposed, protected individuals; and the isolation of the antigen which contains epitopes which induce a protective response. Although almost all individuals exposed to human T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus type III (HTLV-III) develop antibody, most of these do not have neutralizing antibody. The antigen which can induce the response is the major external glycoprotein, which is highly glycosylated (Mr 120,000). Based on past attempts at developing vaccines against retroviruses, the most feasible configuration will be the glycoprotein linked to its transmembrane protein and assembled into micelles or rosettes by hydrophobic bonding. Any virus preparation containing nucleic acids could be considered less safe. An advanced version of such a viral subunit presentation is matrices composed of immunostimulating complexes. This format could also be useful for the inoculation of sequence determined synthetic peptides or genetically engineered readout products of the viral envelope (env) gene. Potential problems exist in that there is extensive heterogeneity among various HTLV-III isolates, particularly in the env gene. This fact and the known relationship of HTLV-III to some lentiviruses suggest that functional antigenic variation could be encountered. The methodology of developing a vaccine against the retroviruses causing AIDS should also be helpful in designing vaccine strategies against human leukemia and lymphomas caused by other members of this virus family.",1985

Clonally distributed (clonotypic) antigen receptors on human T lymphocytes (alpha and beta chains) are associated with three invariable T3 polypeptide chains (T3 gamma, delta and epsilon), together forming the T3/T cell receptor complex. Monoclonal antibodies prepared against the two 20-kd T3 polypeptide chains demonstrated that T3-delta and T3-epsilon are distinct polypeptide chains. Only one monoclonal antibody (anti-T3-delta chain) reacted with the T cell surface as judged by indirect immunofluorescence, and by its mitogenicity for quiescent peripheral blood lymphocytes. Immunohistological staining and immunoprecipitation experiments showed that both the T3-delta and T3-epsilon chains are T cell-specific. As seen with the anti-alpha/beta chain reagent WT-31, anti-T3-delta chain monoclonal antibodies stained medullary thymocytes more intensely than cortical thymocytes, whereas the difference between the staining of cortical and medullary thymocytes was generally not apparent with anti-T3-epsilon chain antibodies. Because of this specificity and their ability to react with both the denatured and the native forms of each polypeptide chain, these new monoclonal reagents will be useful tools in studies of the biosynthesis and cell surface expression of the T3/T cell receptor complex during normal and malignant thymic differentiation.",1985
s51381,intrinsic and extrinsic factors in protein antigenic structure.,"intrinsic and extrinsic factors in protein antigenic structure.. Recent advances in the preparation of synthetic peptide vaccines and the use of synthetic peptides as probes of antigenic structure and function have led to renewed interest in the prediction of antigenic sites recognized by antibodies and T cells. This review focuses on antibodies. Features intrinsic to the antigen, such as hydrophilicity and mobility, may be useful in the selection of amino acid sequences of the native protein that will elicit antibodies cross-reacting with peptides, or sequences which, as peptides, will be more likely to elicit antibodies cross-reactive with the native protein. Structural mobility may also contribute to protein-protein interactions in general. However, the entire accessible surface of a protein is likely to be detectable by a large enough panel of antibodies. Which of these antibodies are made in any individual depends on factors extrinsic to the antigen molecule, host factors such as self-tolerance, immune response genes, idiotype networks, and the immunoglobulin structural gene repertoire.",1985
s51414,"carrier-induced epitopic suppression, a major issue for future synthetic vaccines.","carrier-induced epitopic suppression, a major issue for future synthetic vaccines.. Synthetic antigens have been shown, in experimental models, to induce protective immunity against a variety of pathogens. These studies have demonstrated that, due to their low immunogenicity, these synthetic antigens required conjugation to carrier molecules. Therefore, the choice of appropriate carriers for human immunization by future synthetic vaccines is a major issue. Tetanus toxoid is generally considered to be an effective potential carrier devoid of side-effects. However, the present study performed in mice with two synthetic vaccine models demonstrates that the immune response against the synthetic epitopes conjugated to tetanus toxoid can be suppressed by pre-existing immunity against this same carrier. Because most humans have been exposed to this antigen, this effect may have important implications for the development of synthetic vaccines.",1985
s51445,antigenic variation and resistance to neutralization in poliovirus type 1.,"antigenic variation and resistance to neutralization in poliovirus type 1.. Mutations have been identified in variants of poliovirus, type 1 (Mahoney) on the basis of their resistance to neutralization by individual monoclonal antibodies. The phenotypes of these variants were defined in terms of antibody binding; the pattern of epitopes expressed or able to be exploited for neutralization were complex. Single amino acid changes can have distant (in terms of linear sequence) and generalized effects on the antigenic structure of poliovirus and similarly constituted virions.",1985
s51515,definition by monoclonal antibodies of a repertoire of epitopes on carcinoembryonic antigen differentially expressed in human colon carcinomas versus normal adult tissues.,"definition by monoclonal antibodies of a repertoire of epitopes on carcinoembryonic antigen differentially expressed in human colon carcinomas versus normal adult tissues.. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) designated COL-1 through 15 have been generated and characterized and show a strong degree of selective reactivity for human colon carcinomas versus normal adult tissues. To prepare the MAbs, mice were immunized with extracts or membrane-enriched fractions of biopsy material from either primary or metastatic colon carcinoma lesions. The fifteen COL MAbs, all of the immunoglobulin G subclasses 1, 2a, or 2b, reacted with purified carcinoembryonic antigen in solid-phase radioimmunoassay and by immunoblotting, but none reacted with human polymorphonuclear leukocytes or certain spleen preparations previously shown to be rich in carcinoembryonic antigen-related or cross-reactive antigens. MAbs COL-1 through 15 could be divided into at least five groups based on their differential range of reactivities to the surface of colon carcinoma cells or other carcinoma cell preparations. The COL MAbs were tested via immunoperoxidase with a wide range of primary and metastatic colon carcinomas, benign or dysplastic colon lesions, and 34 normal adult tissues. With few exceptions, the COL MAbs tested in this manner showed reactivity only to the primary and metastatic colon carcinomas. These studies thus provide a well-characterized repertoire of MAbs that are well suited for potential clinical trials involving the radiolocalization and possibly therapy of human colon carcinoma lesions. The fact that at least five epitopes are being recognized also provides the opportunity for testing the efficacy of cocktails of the COL MAbs toward these goals.",1985
s51558,antigenic variation in the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein of human parainfluenza type 3 virus.,"antigenic variation in the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein of human parainfluenza type 3 virus.. Sixteen monoclonal antibodies directed to the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein of a 1957 isolate of parainfluenza type 3 virus (PIV3) were produced and used to examine antigenic variation in clinical strains. Analysis of hemagglutination-inhibition reactivity patterns of antigenic variants selected in vitro in the presence of monoclonal antibodies indicated that there were a minimum of six distinct epitopes detectable on the HN molecule. Competitive-binding assays indicated that these epitopes were located in two topologically nonoverlapping antigenic sites. An additional four epitopes were detected when 37 PIV3 clinical strains isolated over a period of 26 years in three geographic regions were tested for reactivity with the antibodies. Of the 10 unique epitopes defined by our monoclonal antibodies, 5 did not undergo detectable antigenic variation in any of the 37 strains examined. These results were expected since PIV3 viruses have been characterized as being antigenically monotypic. In contrast, antigenic variation was detected in the remaining five epitopes. This variation was not characterized by the accumulation of antigenic alterations with time (as for influenza A viruses), but appeared to represent genetic heterogeneity within the PIV3 population.",1985
s51615,complexes of polyoma virus medium t antigen and cellular proteins.,"complexes of polyoma virus medium t antigen and cellular proteins.. Antibodies against synthetic peptides corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal six amino acids, Lys-Arg-Ser-Arg-His-Phe (KF), and an internal region, Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu-Tyr-Met-Pro-Met-Glu (EE), of polyoma virus medium T antigen were used successively to purify medium T antigen by affinity chromatography. Medium T antigen from cell extracts was first bound to anti-KF antibodies and released from the immune complex with excess KF peptide; then it was bound to anti-EE antibodies and released with excess EE peptide. Two proteins, pp60c-src and a new protein of approximately equal to 61,000 Da (61-kDa protein), were copurified because they formed complexes with medium T antigen. The 61-kDa protein-medium T antigen complex was detected in extracts from wild-type-infected and transformed cells but not from cells infected with NG59 virus, which has a mutation in the medium T gene and is transformation defective. Instead, NG59 medium T antigen formed a complex with another cellular protein of approximately equal to 72,000 Da.",1985
s51679,antigens induced on erythrocytes by p. falciparum: expression of diverse and conserved determinants.,"antigens induced on erythrocytes by p. falciparum: expression of diverse and conserved determinants.. Red blood cells that are infected with the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum express new antigens on their surface. In a study of these antigens in the erythrocytes of naturally infected children in the Gambia, an antibody-mediated agglutination assay revealed an extreme degree of antigenic diversity. Serum samples from each of ten children in the convalescent stage of malaria infection reacted with infected cells from the same child but generally not with infected cells from the other children. The Gambian children's erythrocytes also expressed shared determinants: sera from Gambian adults often reacted with the surface of infected cells from all of the children and were shown by adsorption and elution experiments to contain antibodies that recognized several isolates. Conserved determinants exposed on infected erythrocytes may be important for development of antimalarial immunity either naturally or through vaccination.",1986
s51812,application of a modified computer algorithm in determining potential antigenic determinants associated with the aids virus glycoprotein.,"application of a modified computer algorithm in determining potential antigenic determinants associated with the aids virus glycoprotein.. A computer program was developed for use on an Apple IIe that utilized the parameters developed by Hopp and Woods (T. P. Hopp and K. R. Woods, 1983, Mol. Immunol. 20, 483-489) for predicting the hydrophilic regions of a given protein. This program will produce a listing of the hydrophilic sequence averages and graphically illustrates the peak areas. The hydrophilic averages over a hexapeptide length can be used to predict protein structure. In conjunction with the Chou-Fasman predictive scheme for protein secondary structure determination, the possible antigenic determinants for the envelope glycoprotein of three viruses isolated from patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were predicted. These predicted determinants could be used to generate synthetic peptides that represent a potential vaccine preparation or in developing a diagnostic assay that specifically detects the agent.",1985
s51881,enzyme-linked immunoassay of pre-s gene-coded sequences in hepatitis b vaccines.,"enzyme-linked immunoassay of pre-s gene-coded sequences in hepatitis b vaccines.. Pre-S gene coded domains of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) envelope protein are highly immunogenic in experimental animals and humans. Their presence in HBV and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) particles leads to production of anti-pre-S-specific antibodies during the course of HBV infection. Since antibodies specific for pre-S domains are capable of preventing the attachment of HBV to hepatocytes and are virus neutralizing, it would seem desirable to produce HBV vaccines with a standardized level of pre-S determinants to ensure their potential for eliciting the same repertoire of protective antibodies as found after recovery from natural infection. However, a test with appropriate sensitivity for detecting pre-S determinants to ensure their potential for eliciting the same repertoire of protective antibodies as found after (ELISA) for detecting pre-S determinants in vaccines containing less than or equal to 20 micrograms of HBsAg. The components of this assay are (1) antibodies to a synthetic peptide pre-S (120-145) adsorbed to polystyrene beads, and (2) beta-lactamase-labelled antibodies purified from anti-HBV serum on the basis of their affinity for a pre-S (120-174) beta-galactosidase fusion protein produced in Escherichia coli. Results of an evaluation of the pre-S content of HBV vaccines from two different commercial sources are discussed.",1985
s51908,human prostate-specific antigen: structural and functional similarity with serine proteases.,"human prostate-specific antigen: structural and functional similarity with serine proteases.. The complete amino acid sequence of the prostate-specific antigen (PA) from human seminal plasma has been determined from analyses of the peptides generated by cyanogen bromide, hydroxylamine, endoproteinases Arg-C and Lys-C. The single polypeptide chain of PA contains 240-amino acid residues and has a calculated Mr of 26,496. An N-linked carbohydrate side chain is predicted at asparagine-45, and O-linked carbohydrate side chains are possibly attached to serine-69, threonine-70, and serine-71. The primary structure of PA shows a high degree of sequence homology with other serine proteases of the kallikrein family. The active site residues of histidine, aspartic acid, and serine comprising the charge-relay system of typical serine proteases were found in similar positions in PA (histidine-41, aspartic acid-96, and serine-192). At pH 7.8, PA hydrolyzed insulin A and B chains, recombinant interleukin 2, and--to a lesser extent--gelatin, myoglobin, ovalbumin, and fibrinogen. The cleavage sites of these proteins by PA were chemically analyzed as the alpha-carboxyl side of some hydrophobic residues, tyrosine, leucine, valine, and phenylalanine, and of basic residues histidine, lysine, and arginine. The chymotrypsin-like activity of PA exhibited with the chromogenic substrate N-succinyl-L-alanyl-L-alanyl-L-prolyl-L-phenylalanine p-nitroanilide yielded a specific activity of 9.21 microM per min per mg of PA and Km and kcat values of 15.3 mM and 0.075s-1, respectively.

s51946,immune response to the pre-s(1) region of the hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag): a pre-s(1)-specific t cell response can bypass nonresponsiveness to the pre-s(2) and s regions of hbsag.,"immune response to the pre-s(1) region of the hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag): a pre-s(1)-specific t cell response can bypass nonresponsiveness to the pre-s(2) and s regions of hbsag.. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) particles are composed of a major polypeptide, p25, and additional polypeptides of higher m.w., namely p33 and p39, are variably present. All three polypeptides share the 226 amino acid residues of the S region: p33 consists of the p25 sequence plus an NH2-terminal 55 residues (pre-S(2], and p39 consists of the p33 sequence plus an NH2-terminal 108-119 residues (pre-S(1). In previous studies we demonstrated the influence of two Ir genes on the humoral and cellular immune responses to the S region and identified nonresponder phenotypes (H-2f,s). Subsequent studies showed that the immune response to the pre-S(2) region was regulated by H-2-linked genes independently of the S region response, such that immunization of S region nonresponder, pre-(S2) region responder mice (H-2s) with HBsAg/p33 circumvented nonresponse to the S region. In the present study, we have extended this analysis to the pre-S(1) region of HBsAg, with the following results: 1) and pre-S(1) region is immunogenic at the T and B cell levels; 2) anti-pre-S(1) specific antibody production is regulated by H-2-linked genes and can be independent of anti-S and anti-pre-S(2) antibody production; 3) immunization of H-2f strains with HBsAg/p39 particles containing the pre-S(1) region can bypass nonresponsiveness to the S and pre-S(2) regions in terms of antibody production; 4) two synthetic peptides, p32-53 and p94-117, define murine and human antibody binding sites on the pre-S(1) region, and p1-21 and p12-32 define additional human antibody binding sites; 5) pre-S(1)-specific T cells can be elicited in S and pre-S(2) region nonresponder mice (H-2f) and provide functional T cell help for S-pre-S(2)-, and pre-S(1)-specific antibody production; and 6) a T cell recognition site in the pre-S(1) region, p12-32 was identified. These results are relevant to HBV vaccine development, and possibly to viral clearance mechanisms, since the higher m.w. polypeptides are preferentially expressed on intact virions.",1986
s51949,"antigenic mapping of an avian h1 influenza virus haemagglutinin and interrelationships of h1 viruses from humans, pigs and birds.","antigenic mapping of an avian h1 influenza virus haemagglutinin and interrelationships of h1 viruses from humans, pigs and birds.. Monoclonal antibodies to the haemagglutinin (HA) of the avian H1 influenza virus A/duck/Alberta/35/76 were used to construct an operational antigenic map of the HA molecule and to study the interrelationships of H1 viruses from different hosts. Haemagglutination inhibition tests between the monoclonal antibodies and variants selected by them provided evidence of four antigenic regions which overlap to varying degrees. Avian H1 influenza viruses displayed a spectrum of reactivities to the monoclonal antibody panel. Representatives of the epidemic strains of human H1 influenza viruses and early swine influenza viruses showed little or no reactivity with the monoclonal antibodies but swine influenza-like viruses isolated from pigs and humans in the last decade reacted with 11 of 17 antibodies. The antigenic similarity of these viruses to many avian isolates suggests that there has been a transfer of HA genetic information between mammalian and avian H1 influenza viruses.",1986
s52000,nonoverlapping t and b cell determinants on an hepatitis b surface antigen pre-s(2) region synthetic peptide.,"nonoverlapping t and b cell determinants on an hepatitis b surface antigen pre-s(2) region synthetic peptide.. We have examined T cell recognition of a hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), pre-S(2)-region synthetic peptide, p120-145, in terms of fine specificity, H-2-linked genetic influences, comparison to antibody binding, and relevance to T cell recognition of the native protein. We showed that the immune response to the synthetic peptide is regulated by H-2-linked genes, but that the pattern of H-2 restriction differed from that observed for the native anti-pre-S(2) response. Dominant and nonoverlapping T cell and B cell recognition sites were identified on the synthetic peptide p120-145. T cell recognition is focussed on the NH2-terminal sequence, and antibody (B cell) recognition is focussed on the COOH-terminal sequence. The fine specificity of T cell recognition of p120-145 was defined by a single, subtype-dependent amino acid substitution. With respect to the immunogenicity of p120-145, the synthetic peptide containing both T and B cell determinants is highly immunogenic in responder strains, whereas separate T or B cell peptide determinants are minimally immunogenic. Furthermore, the synthetic T cell recognition site can prime T cell help for antibody production to the synthetic B cell site, which is crossreactive with the native pre-S(2) region of HBsAg/p33 particles. This system provides evidence that totally synthetic T cell and B cell recognition sites can be combined to yield a functional immunogen.",1986
s52016,a poliovirus neutralization epitope expressed on hybrid hepatitis b surface antigen particles.,"a poliovirus neutralization epitope expressed on hybrid hepatitis b surface antigen particles.. The hepatitis B virus (HBV) envelope protein carrying the surface antigen (HBsAg) is assembled with cellular lipids in mammalian cells into empty viral envelopes. In a study to evaluate the capacity of such particles to present foreign peptide sequences in a biologically active form, in-phase insertions were created in the S gene encoding the major envelope protein. One of the sequences inserted was a synthetic DNA fragment encoding a poliovirus neutralization epitope. Mammalian cells expressing the modified gene secreted hybrid particles closely resembling authentic 22-nanometer HBsAg particles. These particles reacted with a poliovirus-specific monoclonal antibody and induced neutralizing antibodies against poliovirus. The results indicate that empty viral envelopes of HBV may provide a means for the presentation of peptide sequences and for their export from mammalian cells.",1986
s52042,molecular cloning and expression in escherichia coli k-12 of the o antigens of the inaba and ogawa serotypes of the vibrio cholerae o1 lipopolysaccharides and their potential for vaccine development.,"molecular cloning and expression in escherichia coli k-12 of the o antigens of the inaba and ogawa serotypes of the vibrio cholerae o1 lipopolysaccharides and their potential for vaccine development.. The gene clusters that determine the biosynthesis of both the Inaba and Ogawa serotypes of the O antigen of the lipopolysaccharide of Vibrio cholerae were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli K-12. Restriction analysis of the clones demonstrated that about 15 kilobases were common to all clones and a further 5 kilobases were common to the Ogawa clones. The O antigens expressed by E. coli K-12 had the specificity of V. cholerae. Antibodies raised against E. coli K-12 that harbor one of these clones, pPM1001 (Inaba), were as highly protective in the infant mouse model system as were antibodies to V. cholerae itself. Introduction of such clones into suitable carrier strains could be expected to produce a good oral immunogen against cholera.",1986
s52071,detection of antibodies to human t-lymphotropic virus type iii by using a synthetic peptide of 21 amino acid residues corresponding to a highly antigenic segment of gp41 envelope protein.,"detection of antibodies to human t-lymphotropic virus type iii by using a synthetic peptide of 21 amino acid residues corresponding to a highly antigenic segment of gp41 envelope protein.. A peptide of 21 amino acids with the sequence Arg-Ile-Leu-Ala-Val-Glu-Arg-Tyr-Leu-Lys-Asp-Gln-Gln-Leu-Leu-Gly-Ile-Trp- Gly-Cys - Ser encoded by a segment in the env gene of human T-lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III), corresponding to amino acids 586-606 of the precursor envelope glycoprotein, has been synthesized by the Merrifield solid-phase method. Combined serological and chemical analyses of this peptide and related peptides have revealed the importance of certain amino acid residues in the antigenic determinant of the relevant peptide. Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) employing this peptide as an antigen adsorbent was shown to reproducibly detect antibodies in sera of patients with HTLV-III infection. This assay provided positive results with all sera that were reactive with gp41 envelope protein of HTLV-III in electrophoretic immunoblot analysis. Thus far, no false-positive sera have been encountered in control populations. Our EIA with this peptide as the coating antigen is shown to have advantages over that with the whole HTLV-III virus as an immunoadsorbent.",1986
s52087,expression of hepatitis b virus surface antigen p31 gene in  yeast.,"expression of hepatitis b virus surface antigen p31 gene in  yeast.. The hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) P31 gene has been expressed in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The gene products were shown to be glycoproteins with molecular sizes of 37,000 and 34,000 daltons (GP37 and GP34) containing polymerized albumin receptors. Successfully detecting these proteins depended on the extraction procedures. In the extract without protein denaturants and inhibitors, these products were degraded rapidly by proteases to yield smaller size derivatives lacking polymerized albumin receptors. As is the case in human serum-derived HBsAg, yeast HBsAg consisting of GP37 and GP34 was found to be particles or aggregates having a buoyant density of 1.2 g/cc; these particles bound to polymerized human serum albumin in species-specific manner.",1986
s52097,structural and functional implications of a restricted antibody response to a defined antigenic region on the influenza virus hemagglutinin.,"structural and functional implications of a restricted antibody response to a defined antigenic region on the influenza virus hemagglutinin.. A group of hybridoma antibodies that recognize structurally overlapping epitopes on the influenza virus hemagglutinin have been analyzed for the sequence of their immunoglobulin heavy and light chain variable regions. All VH regions derive from the same gene family, and only two Vk genes, from different families, are involved. The repetitive and restricted use of these variable region genes indicates that considerable structural requirements influence the generation of antibodies specific for this region of the hemagglutinin. The degree of amino acid variability which is permissive for interaction with this region suggests that two thirds of the possible replacement mutations may abolish either antibody function or specificity. Analysis of the somatic mutation which occurred in the individual antibodies indicates that the light chains acquired replacement mutations at the rate predicted for random mutation. The heavy chains, however, accumulated a 3-fold excess of replacement mutations over that predicted for random accumulation, correlating with the dominant role they apparently play in determining fine differences in the specificity of these antibodies. The effect of somatic mutation on the clonal amplification and diversification of these B cell lineages is discussed.",1986
s52113,novel hepatitis b vaccines.,"novel hepatitis b vaccines.. Development of vaccines against hepatitis B has proceeded along four main lines. Human plasma-derived vaccines are safe, effective, and in general use. Subunit polypeptide vaccines formulated in micelles have reached the stage of clinical trials. Recombinant DNA vaccines have been produced in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, notably in yeast. The yeast-derived recombinant vaccine has proved safe and effective in extensive clinical trials, eliciting antibodies of equal quantity and quality of specificity to those elicited by plasma-derived vaccine. DNA recombination has also been applied to the development of hybrid vaccinia virus vaccines which are capable of immunological 'priming'. Finally, chemical synthesis has succeeded in producing small peptides which include specific epitopes eliciting antibody responses in experimental animals. This last approach offers a prospect of ultimately producing multivalent synthetic vaccines against several microbial agents.",1986
s52117,the t cell repertoire for recognition of a phylogenetically distant protein antigen. peptide specificity and mhc restriction of staphylococcal nuclease-specific t cell clones.,"the t cell repertoire for recognition of a phylogenetically distant protein antigen. peptide specificity and mhc restriction of staphylococcal nuclease-specific t cell clones.. Previous studies (1) have indicated that the repertoire of murine T cells specific for a potentially complex protein antigen is in fact specific for a limited number of antigenic epitopes on that antigen in association with a given Ia molecule. Since those studies generally analyzed responses to antigens that differ in only a few amino acids from homologous murine molecules, it was possible that tolerance to self proteins was responsible for the limited T cell repertoire seen in responses to closely related proteins. It was therefore of interest to determine whether T cell recognition of a structurally and phylogenetically more distant protein molecule would also show specificity for a limited number of immunodominant peptides on that molecule. A series of experiments was designed to study the antigen fine specificity and MHC restriction of T cell clones specific for the bacterially derived antigen staphylococcal nuclease (Nase). T cell clones generated in (H-2b X H-2a)F1 (B6AF1) T cells were shown to be specific for Nase and to be restricted by either Ab alpha Ab beta or Ek alpha Ek beta. The fine specificity of these clones was then analyzed using cyanogen bromide and tryptic fragments and a series of overlapping 20-amino-acid synthetic peptides corresponding to and spanning the entire sequence of the Nase molecule. Two Ab alpha Ab beta-restricted clones were highly responsive to peptide 91-110, and not to other synthetic Nase peptides. In contrast, seven Ek alpha Ek beta-restricted clones were consistently responsive to peptide 81-100 and not to 91-110 or to other Nase peptides. Certain of these Ek alpha Ek beta-restricted T cells expressed an interesting crossreactivity, in that they responded to peptide 51-70 as well as to 81-100, although the response to 51-70 was characterized by a markedly shifted dose-response curve, indicating a reduced efficiency of activation by this peptide. Analysis of the amino acid sequences of these regions indicates that this unexpected crossreaction may have a structural basis. A single Nase-specific T cell line generated from BALB/c T cells was, in contrast to any of the B6AF1 clones studied, responsive only to peptide 61-80 and not to other peptides, including 81-100 or 91-110. Collectively, these findings show that Nase-specific T cells are responsive to discrete Nase peptides. Moreover, the present findings suggest that in T cell recognition of a complex and highly foreign protein antigen, a limited number of peptide epitopes are preferentially recognized by T cells in association with a given Ia molecule.",1986
s52134,efficient mapping of protein antigenic determinants.,"efficient mapping of protein antigenic determinants.. A recombinant DNA expression strategy has been used to deduce the amino acid sequences of six different antigenic determinants in a single protein of Mycobacterium leprae, the etiologic agent of leprosy. The gene encoding the M. leprae 65-kDa antigen was sequenced and a lambda gt11 gene sublibrary was constructed with fragments of the gene. Recombinant DNA clones producing specific antigenic determinants were isolated by screening with monoclonal antibodies, and the sequences of their insert DNAs were determined with a rapid primer-extension method. The amino acid sequence of each determinant was deduced from the minimum overlap of insert DNAs from multiple antibody-positive DNA clones. Amino acid sequences for six different epitopes were elucidated. A peptide containing sequences for one of these epitopes was synthesized and shown to bind the appropriate monoclonal antibody; this antigenic determinant is unique to M. leprae. The approach described here can be used to rapidly elucidate protein epitopes that are recognized by antibodies or T cells.",1986
s52253,new hydrophilicity scale derived from high-performance liquid chromatography peptide retention data: correlation of predicted surface residues with antigenicity and x-ray-derived accessible sites.,"new hydrophilicity scale derived from high-performance liquid chromatography peptide retention data: correlation of predicted surface residues with antigenicity and x-ray-derived accessible sites.. A new set of hydrophilicity high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) parameters is presented. These parameters were derived from the retention times of 20 model synthetic peptides, Ac-Gly-X-X-(Leu)3-(Lys)2-amide, where X was substituted with the 20 amino acids found in proteins. Since hydrophilicity parameters have been used extensively in algorithms to predict which amino acid residues are antigenic, we have compared the profiles generated by our new set of hydrophilic HPLC parameters on the same scale as nine other sets of parameters. Generally, it was found that the HPLC parameters obtained in this study correlated best with antigenicity. In addition, it was shown that a combination of the three best parameters for predicting antigenicity further improved the predictions. These predicted surface sites or, in other words, the hydrophilic, accessible, or mobile regions were then correlated to the known antigenic sites from immunological studies and accessible sites determined by X-ray crystallographic data for several proteins.",1986
s52295,variable and conserved neutralization antigens of human immunodeficiency virus.,"variable and conserved neutralization antigens of human immunodeficiency virus.. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1, HTLV-III/LAV), the retrovirus responsible for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), shows a high degree of genetic polymorphism, particularly in the env gene. We have examined sera from rabbits and guinea pigs immunized with gp130, a recombinant env glycoprotein, and sera from HIV-1-infected subjects, to test their capacity to neutralize a panel of genetically divergent HIV-1 isolates. The sera raised against recombinant antigen specifically neutralized the virus strain from which the env gene was cloned (HTLV-IIIB), but not an independent isolate (HTLV-IIIRF). One rabbit serum tested on seven isolates cross-neutralized two at lower titres. In contrast, human sera from Britain and Uganda, chosen for ability to neutralize HTLV-IIIRF, cross-neutralized six other HIV-1 isolates. When serum and isolate were derived from the same subject, the serum was in some cases effective at slightly lower concentrations (higher titres). Human complement did not affect neutralization titres. These findings indicate that genetically diverse HIV-1 isolates carry both variable and widely conserved antigenic epitopes for neutralizing antibodies. The identification of shared epitopes may help the development of protective vaccines.",1986
s52371,human t cell clones recognize two abundant mycobacterium tuberculosis protein antigens expressed in escherichia coli.,"human t cell clones recognize two abundant mycobacterium tuberculosis protein antigens expressed in escherichia coli.. Human T cells reactive to Mycobacterium tuberculosis were cloned from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of four tuberculosis patients by using whole irradiated bacilli as the in vitro stimulatory agent. Twenty-two T cell clones (CD4+) were tested for their reactivity to 12 different mycobacterial species and showed a distribution from limited to broad cross-reactivity. These T cell clones were also tested for their reactivity to three abundant M. tuberculosis proteins of 65, 19, and 14 kD, each expressed from recombinant DNA in Escherichia coli. The three proteins were expressed from DNA clones that were previously isolated from a lambda gt11 genomic DNA library of M. tuberculosis by using monoclonal antibodies directed against this pathogen. A T cell clone from one patient was stimulated by an E. coli lysate containing the 65 kD antigen, and a T cell clone from a second patient was stimulated by an E. coli lysate containing the 19 kD antigen in an in vitro proliferation assay. Both T cell clones showed very limited cross-reactivity when tested against other mycobacteria. We conclude that some patients with tuberculosis exhibit a T cell response to the 65 and 19 kD M. tuberculosis proteins defined by these isolated genes.",1987
s52379,computer-assisted analysis of envelope protein sequences of seven human immunodeficiency virus isolates: prediction of antigenic epitopes in conserved and variable regions.,"computer-assisted analysis of envelope protein sequences of seven human immunodeficiency virus isolates: prediction of antigenic epitopes in conserved and variable regions.. Independent isolates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exhibit a striking genomic diversity, most of which is located in the viral envelope gene. Since this property of the HIV group of viruses may play an important role in the pathobiology of the virus, we analyzed the predicted amino acid sequences of the envelope proteins of seven different HIV strains, three of which represent sequential isolates from a single patient. By using a computer program that predicts the secondary protein structure and superimposes values for hydrophilicity, surface probability, and flexibility, we identified several potential antigenic epitopes in the envelope proteins of the seven different viruses. Interestingly, the majority of the predicted epitopes in the exterior envelope protein (gp120) were found in regions of high sequence variability which are interspersed with highly conserved regions among the independent viral isolates. A comparison of the sequential viral isolates revealed that changes concerning the secondary structure of the protein occurred only in regions which were predicted to be antigenic, predominantly in highly variable regions. The membrane-associated protein gp41 contains no highly variable regions; about 80% of the amino acids were found to be conserved, and only one hydrophilic area was identified as likely to be accessible to antibody recognition. These findings give insight into the secondary and possible tertiary structure of variant HIV envelope proteins and should facilitate experimental approaches directed toward the identification and fine mapping of HIV envelope proteins.",1987
s52544,prevention of shigellosis by a salmonella typhi-shigella sonnei bivalent vaccine.,"prevention of shigellosis by a salmonella typhi-shigella sonnei bivalent vaccine.. We genetically modified attenuated Salmonella typhi strain Ty21a to express the form I O polysaccharide antigen of Shigella sonnei. Three doses of this bivalent, live oral vaccine strain (1-8 X 10(9) organisms/dose) were given to young adults who, along with unvaccinated controls, were challenged one month later with pathogenic S. sonnei. The vaccinees had 40% protection against diarrhea and 56% against Hematest-positive diarrhea. Two of three vaccine lots provided higher levels of protection (53% against diarrhea and 71% against Hematest-positive diarrhea), but the third lot, prepared for a large-scale field trial, demonstrated no protective efficacy. Vaccinees had serum and local intestinal immune responses to S. sonnei lipopolysaccharide, and the presence of specific serum IgA or IgG antibody before challenge with pathogenic S. sonnei was correlated with protection from illness. Some lots of this bivalent vaccine strain provide significant protection against S. sonnei disease, but the problem of lot-to-lot variability must be overcome.",1987
s52547,"antigenic and structural properties of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase glycoprotein of human parainfluenza virus type 3: sequence analysis of variants selected with monoclonal antibodies which inhibit infectivity, hemagglutination, and neuraminidase activities.","antigenic and structural properties of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase glycoprotein of human parainfluenza virus type 3: sequence analysis of variants selected with monoclonal antibodies which inhibit infectivity, hemagglutination, and neuraminidase activities.. The hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) gene sequence was determined for 16 antigenic variants of human parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3). The variants were selected by using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to the HN protein which inhibit neuraminidase, hemagglutination, or both activities. Each variant had a single-point mutation in the HN gene, coding for a single amino acid substitution in the HN protein. Operational and topographic maps of the HN protein correlated well with the relative positions of the substitutions. There was little correlation between the cross-reactivity of a MAb with the bovine PIV3 HN and the amount of amino acid homology between the human and bovine PIV3 HN proteins in the regions of the epitopes, suggesting that many of the epitopes are conformational in nature. Computer-assisted analysis of the HN protein predicted a secondary structure composed primarily of hydrophobic beta sheets interconnected by random hydrophilic coil structures. The HN epitopes were located in predicted coil regions. Epitopes recognized by MAbs which inhibit neuraminidase activity of the virus were located in a region which appears to be structurally conserved among several paramyxovirus HN proteins and which may represent the sialic cid-binding site of the HN molecule.",1987
s52606,5'-structural analysis of genes encoding polymorphic antigens of chemically induced tumors.,"5'-structural analysis of genes encoding polymorphic antigens of chemically induced tumors.. We have proposed that the distinct tumor rejection antigens of chemically induced sarcomas in inbred mice belong to a family of Mr 96,000 glycoproteins (gp96). An identical 14-amino acid sequence was found at the amino terminus of gp96 from two antigenically distinct BALB/c sarcomas. Oligonucleotide probes derived from this sequence permitted isolation of 5' cDNA and genomic fragments coding for gp96. Three short exons interrupted by relatively long introns were identified at the 5' terminus of the gp96 gene. The first exon encodes a signal peptide, which is consistent with gp96 being a cell surface antigen. Southern blot analysis indicated that the gp96 family is encoded by a single gene, and 3-kilobase transcripts were detected in all normal and tumor cells tested. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences from 311 base paris at the 5' terminus showed no homology with any known protein. The availability of molecular probes for the gp96 system permits analysis of the structural polymorphism of these antigens.",1987
s52608,helper t-cell antigenic site identification in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome virus gp120 envelope protein and induction of immunity in mice to the native protein using a 16-residue synthetic peptide.,"helper t-cell antigenic site identification in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome virus gp120 envelope protein and induction of immunity in mice to the native protein using a 16-residue synthetic peptide.. Much effort has been devoted to the analysis of antibodies to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome virus antigens, but no studies, to our knowledge, have defined antigenic sites of this virus that elicit T-cell immunity, even though such immunity is important in protection against many other viruses. T cells tend to recognize only a limited number of discrete sites on a protein antigen. Analysis of immunodominant helper T-cell sites has suggested that such sites tend to form amphipathic helices. An algorithm based on this model was used to identify two candidate T-cell sites, env T1 and env T2, in the envelope protein of human T-lymphotropic virus type IIIB that were conserved in other human immunodeficiency virus isolates. Corresponding peptides were synthesized and studied in genetically defined inbred and F1 mice for induction of lymph node proliferation. After immunization with a 426-residue recombinant envelope protein fragment, significant responses to native gp 120, as well as to each peptide, were observed in both F1 combinations studied. Conversely, immunization with env T1 peptide induced T-cell immunity to the native gp 120 envelope protein. The genetics of the response to env T1 peptide were further examined and revealed a significant response in three of four independent major histocompatibility haplotypes tested, an indication of high frequency responsiveness in the population. Identification of helper T-cell sites should facilitate development of a highly immunogenic, carrier-free vaccine that induces T-cell and B-cell immunity. The ability to elicit T-cell immunity to the native viral protein by immunization with a 16-residue peptide suggests that such sites represent potentially important components of an effective vaccine for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.",1987
s52628,prediction of antigenic determinants and secondary structures of the major aids virus proteins.,"prediction of antigenic determinants and secondary structures of the major aids virus proteins.. Criteria for the design of peptide vaccines to prevent AIDS are presented. The best vaccine candidates contain both B and T lymphocyte-defined epitopes in regions conserved in sequence between viral isolates. We propose that attention should focus on proteins specified by the gag and, possibly, pol genes in addition to the env gene envelope glycoproteins being actively studied. The predictions of B- and T-epitopes are refined by consideration of secondary structure prediction and inter-isolate sequence variability to suggest peptides from env, gag and pol that would be the best vaccine candidates.",1987
s52658,identification of the t-cell and ia contact residues of a t-cell antigenic epitope.,"identification of the t-cell and ia contact residues of a t-cell antigenic epitope.. The precise molecular structure of the antigenic determinant recognized by the T-cell receptor of the CD4-positive cell has not been completely resolved. A major advance in our understanding of this issue has been made by our demonstration of a direct association between an immunogenic peptide and a purified Ia molecule. The most likely and economical hypothesis is that antigen binds directly to an Ia molecule creating the antigenic determinant and that this antigen-Ia complex is recognized by the T-cell receptor. We examined in detail a determinant of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL) contained in the tryptic fragment HEL(46-61), recognized by T cells in H-2k strains of mice. This peptide binds with a Kd of approximately 3 microM to I-Ak molecules. We have already ascertained that (1) the 10-mer HEL(52-61) is the shortest stimulatory peptide; (2) the Leu56 residue, the only residue different from mouse lysozyme, is responsible for the immunogenicity; (3) the Leu56 and Tyr53 residues are critical for recognition by the T-cell receptor and (4) HEL(46-61) generates multiple determinants when it associated with the I-Ak molecule. If antigen and Ia interact, the antigen must have two features: it must bind to an Ia molecule and also interact with the T-cell receptor. The two sites do not appear to be laterally separable in this peptide and are therefore probably composed of distinct but interspersed amino-acid residues. We have now identified the three residues of HEL(52-61) that contact the T-cell receptor and three other residues that contact the I-Ak molecule. From modelling studies we also propose that HEL(52-61) assumes an alpha-helical conformation as it is bound to I-Ak and recognized by the T-cell receptor.",1987
s52690,mapping of t cell epitopes using recombinant antigens and synthetic peptides.,"mapping of t cell epitopes using recombinant antigens and synthetic peptides.. Two complementary approaches were used to determine the epitope specificity of clonal and polyclonal human T lymphocytes reactive with the 65-kd antigen of Mycobacterium leprae. A recombinant DNA sublibrary constructed from portions of the 65-kd gene was used to map T cell determinants within amino acid sequences 101-146 and 409-526. Independently, potential T cell epitopes within the protein were predicted based on an empirical analysis of specific patterns in the amino acid sequence. Of six peptides that were predicted and subsequently synthesised, two (112-132 and 437-459) were shown to contain human T cell epitopes. This corroborated and refined the results obtained using the recombinant DNA sublibrary. Both of these regions are identical in M. leprae and M. tuberculosis and are distinct from the known B cell epitopes of the 65-kd protein. This combination of recombinant DNA technology and peptide chemistry may prove valuable in analysis of the cellular immune response to infectious agents.",1987
s52712,immune response to hepatitis b virus core antigen (hbcag): localization of t cell recognition sites within hbcag/hbeag.,"immune response to hepatitis b virus core antigen (hbcag): localization of t cell recognition sites within hbcag/hbeag.. Hepatitis B virus nucleocapsid particles (HBcAg) can function as a T cell-independent antigen when injected into athymic mice. However, immunization of euthymic mice with HBcAg results in dramatically increased anti-HBc titers. Therefore we have examined the murine T cell response to HBcAg in terms of immunogenicity, the influence of H-2-linked genes, and the fine specificity of T cell recognition using synthetic peptide analogs. The HBcAg was shown to be an extremely efficient immunogen in terms of T cell activation as measured by the in vivo dose required to induce T cell sensitization (1.0 microgram), and the minimal in vitro concentration required to elicit interleukin 2 (IL 2) production (0.03 ng/ml). The degree of T cell immunogenicity of HBcAg and its ability to directly activate B cells most likely explain the enhanced humoral response to HBcAg in euthymic mice and HBV-infected patients. The influence of H-2-linked genes on the humoral response to HBcAg was discernable, and high responder (H-2k,s,d), intermediate responder (H-2b,f), and low responder (H-2p) haplotypes were identified. The H-2-linked regulation of the T cell response correlated with in vivo anti-HBc production. Examination of the fine specificity of T cell recognition revealed HBcAg-specific T cells from a variety of strains recognize multiple but distinct sites within the HBcAg/HBeAg sequence. T cell recognition sites were defined by small (16 to 21 residue) synthetic peptides. Each strain recognized a predominant T cell determinant, and the fine specificity of this recognition process was dependent on the H-2 haplotype of the responding strain. For example H-2s,b strains recognized p120-140, H-2f,q strains recognized p100-120, and H-2d mice recognized p85-100 predominantly. Because these sequences are common to both HBcAg and a nonparticulate form of the antigen termed HBeAg, these results indicate that HBcAg and HBeAg are highly cross-reactive at the T cell level although they are serologically distinct. These findings may have clinical relevance, because T cell sensitization to HBeAg and the subsequent seroconversion to anti-HBe status correlates with viral clearance during hepatitis B infection.",1987
s52897,genetically engineered diphtheria toxin fusion proteins carrying the hepatitis b surface antigen.,"genetically engineered diphtheria toxin fusion proteins carrying the hepatitis b surface antigen.. Tripartite fusion proteins comprising the nontoxic mutant protein CRM228 of diphtheria toxin (DT), the hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), and beta-galactosidase were obtained by expression of hybrid genes from the pR promoter of bacteriophage lambda and purification by affinity chromatography. The antigenicity and immunogenicity of the individual protein constituents were analyzed. A major neutralizing epitope of DT was inactivated by the HBsAg insertion into the DT B fragment. The fusion proteins elicited antibodies reactive with 22 nm HBsAg particles. This suggests a novel approach towards the use of DT mutants as immunogenic carriers of heterologous antigens.",1987
s52976,protective immunisation against hepatitis b with an internal antigen of the virus.,"protective immunisation against hepatitis b with an internal antigen of the virus.. Preparations of hepatitis B virus (HBV) core antigen (HBcAg) synthesised in Escherichia coli have been shown previously to confer partial immunity against infection by the virus [Murray, Bruce, Hinnen, Wingfield, van Eerd, de Reus, and Schellekens: EMBO Journal 3:645-650, 1984]. In a further experiment reported here, immunisation of chimpanzees with a similar preparation of HBcAg that had been treated with sodium dodecyl sulphate in order to expose e antigen epitopes was found to protect one animal completely and another quite substantially upon challenge with the virus. The results are used to support the argument for trials in humans of a vaccine against HBV based upon or containing HBcAg and its e antigen derivative, and in discussion of a more general role for internal antigens in generating immunity against viral infection.",1987
s53011,the nucleotide sequence of herpes simplex virus type 2 (333) glycoprotein gb2 and analysis of predicted antigenic sites.,"the nucleotide sequence of herpes simplex virus type 2 (333) glycoprotein gb2 and analysis of predicted antigenic sites.. The gene coding for glycoprotein B2 (gB2) of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) strain 333 was mapped and its nucleotide sequence determined. Open reading frame analysis deduced a polypeptide consisting of 902 amino acids and having close homology to gB1 of HSV type 1. Several predicted features of gB2 are consistent with a membrane-bound glycoprotein, i.e., a signal peptide sequence, a hydrophilic extracellular domain containing possible N-linked glycosylation sites, a hydrophobic membrane spanning sequence, and a cytoplasmic domain. Computer analysis on hydrophilicity, accessibility, and flexibility of the gB2 amino acid sequence, produced a composite surface value plot. At least nine major antigenic regions were predicted on the extracellular domain. The amino acids between residues 59-74, 127-139, 199-205, 460-476, and 580-594 exhibited the highest surface values. Comparison of the primary sequence with gB1 revealed localized regions showing amino acid diversity. Several of these locations correspond to major antigenic regions. Chou and Fasman analyses indicated that the amino acid substitutions, between positions 57-66, 461-472, and 473-481, induced changes in the secondary structure of gB. These sites could represent site-specific epitopes in the gB polypeptide.",1987
s53049,mapping of functional and antigenic domains of the alpha 4 protein of herpes simplex virus 1.,"mapping of functional and antigenic domains of the alpha 4 protein of herpes simplex virus 1.. Monoclonal antibodies to alpha 4, the major regulatory protein of herpes simplex virus 1, have been shown to differ in their effects on the binding of the protein to its DNA-binding site in the promoter-regulatory domain of an alpha gene. To map the epitopes, we expressed truncated genes in transient expression systems. All 10 monoclonal antibodies tested reacted with the N-terminal 288-amino-acid polypeptide. To map the epitopes more precisely, 29 15-mer oligopeptides, overlapping by five amino acids at each end, were synthesized and reacted with the monoclonal antibodies. The nine reactive monoclonal antibodies were mapped to seven sites. Of the two monoclonal antibodies which blocked the binding of alpha 4 to DNA, one (H950) reacted with oligopeptide no. 3 near the N terminal of the protein, whereas the second (H942) reacted with oligopeptide no. 23 near the C terminus of the 288-amino-acid polypeptide. In further tests, oligopeptide no. 19 was found to compete with two host proteins, designated as alpha H1 and alpha H2-alpha H3, for binding to DNA as well as to retard DNA in a band shift assay, whereas oligopeptides no. 26, 27, and 28 enhanced the binding of alpha 4 to DNA. Moreover, oligopeptide no. 27 was also found to retard DNA in a band shift assay. Polypeptide no. 19 competed with alpha 4 for binding to DNA, whereas no. 27 neither enhanced nor competed with the binding of the host polypeptide alpha H1 to its binding site in the promoter-regulatory domain of an alpha gene, but did enhance the binding of the alpha H2-alpha H3 protein to its binding site. In contrast to these results, the truncated alpha 4 polypeptide, 825 amino acids long, bound to the viral DNA, whereas a shorter, 519-amino-acid-long, truncated polypeptide did not. The 825-amino-acid polypeptide was previously shown to induce in transient expression of a late (gamma 2) viral gene.",1988
s53050,a single antigenomic open reading frame of the hepatitis delta virus encodes the epitope(s) of both hepatitis delta antigen polypeptides p24 delta and p27 delta.,"a single antigenomic open reading frame of the hepatitis delta virus encodes the epitope(s) of both hepatitis delta antigen polypeptides p24 delta and p27 delta.. On the basis of the complete nucleotide sequence of the single-stranded, covalently closed circular hepatitis delta virus RNA genome (K.-S. Wang, Q.-L. Choo, A. J. Weiner, J.-H. Ou, R. C. Najarian, R. M. Thayer, G. T. Mullenbach, K. J. Denniston, J. L. Gerin, and M. Houghton, Nature [London] 323:508-514, 1986 [Author's correction, 328:456, 1987]), five long open reading frames (ORFs) encoding polypeptides containing a methionine proximal to the amino terminus were expressed in bacteria. Only polypeptides encoded by the antigenomic ORF5 cross-reacted with antisera obtained from patients with hepatitis delta virus infections. Immunological analysis of viral extracts and the recombinant ORF5 polypeptides synthesized in bacteria and yeast cells revealed that ORF5 encodes the immunogenic epitope(s) shared by both hepatitis delta viral polypeptides p27 delta and p24 delta and probably represents the complete structural gene for p27 delta and p24 delta. We also present evidence that ORF5 encodes the hepatitis delta antigen, an antigen originally found in the nuclei of hepatocytes of infected individuals (M. Rizzetto, M. G. Canese, S. Arico, O. Crivelli, F. Bonino, C. G. Trepo, and G. Verme, Gut 18:997-1003, 1977). A comparison of the primary structure of the predicted hepatitis delta antigen polypeptides with that of the core antigen of the hepatitis B virus shows that these polypeptides are very dissimilar.",1988
s53096,a candidate vaccine for hepatitis b containing the complete viral surface protein.,"a candidate vaccine for hepatitis b containing the complete viral surface protein.. The entire surface protein of hepatitis B virus serotype ayw containing the preS (preS1+preS2) and S domains has been expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast containing a recombinant plasmid utilizing a constitutive promoter did not express this gene successfully due to the toxicity of the protein. A plasmid using a regulatable promoter directed expression which initiated late in the exponential phase of growth and resulted in the accumulation of high intracellular levels of the complete surface protein. The purified polypeptide aggregates into a form which, although not comprised of typical 20 nm particles, displays antigenic determinants encoded by the preS1, preS2 and S domains. Immunization of rabbits elicited the formation of antibodies directed against all three domains. This candidate vaccine will be useful for studying the contributions to viral immunity of the host response to the preS1 and preS2 domains.",1988
s53165,use of outer membrane protein phoe as a carrier for the transport of a foreign antigenic determinant to the cell surface of escherichia coli k-12.,use of outer membrane protein phoe as a carrier for the transport of a foreign antigenic determinant to the cell surface of escherichia coli k-12.. PhoE protein is an abundant transmembrane protein from the Escherichia coli K-12 outer membrane. A synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide corresponding to an antigenic determinant of the C-terminal part of the VP1 protein of foot-and-mouth disease virus was inserted into the phoE gene in an area corresponding to a cell surface-exposed region of the PhoE protein. The level of expression of the hybrid protein was normal and the protein was incorporated into the outer membrane. The VP1-epitope was exposed at the cell surface since intact cells were recognized by a monoclonal antibody which was raised against the virus.,1987
s53227,structural features unique to each of the three antigenic sites on the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein of newcastle disease virus.,"structural features unique to each of the three antigenic sites on the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein of newcastle disease virus.. Antigenic variants of D26 strain of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) were selected with monoclonal antibodies directed to the three nonoverlapping antigenic sites on the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein, and their HN genes were sequenced to identify the amino acids important for the integrity of each site. Seven variants for site I, which is immunodominant and conserved among NDV strains, had a change of glutamic acid at position 347, mostly to lysine, and in a single case, to glycine. In the second group of two variants for site IV, a change of asparagine to aspartic acid was found at position 481. This resulted in elimination of the oligosaccharide attached to this asparagine residue of the parental virus. Together with the finding that the site IV was destroyed by treatment with endoglycosidase F, it was suggested that the oligosaccharide is important for maintaining the structure of site IV. The oligosaccharide appeared to contribute to exposing a nearby determinant by conferring hydrophilicity on it. A variant for site II had also a nonconservative mutation resulting in the change of glutamic acid to valine at position 495. The site I recognized by antibodies which inhibit neuraminidase activity with a small substrate neuraminlactose was located closer to the predicted sialic acid-binding site than to the other sites recognized by antibodies lacking the enzyme-inhibiting capacity. The sequence of the parental virus HN gene revealed that the HNo precursor for the HN protein is an extra-long protein whose C terminus is elongated by 45 amino acids, compared with the usual HN protein sequenced in parallel.",1988
s53297,isolation and characterization of recombinant lambda gt11 bacteriophages expressing eight different mycobacterial antigens of potential immunological relevance.,"isolation and characterization of recombinant lambda gt11 bacteriophages expressing eight different mycobacterial antigens of potential immunological relevance.. A genomic lambda gt11 DNA library of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was screened for expression of mycobacterial protein antigens with murine monoclonal antibodies. The reactivity patterns of the monoclonal antibodies ranged from those showing a limited interspecies reactivity to antibodies widely cross-reactive among different mycobacterial species. Twelve recombinant bacteriophages were isolated, containing eight mycobacterial genes (paa, pab, pac, pad, paeA, paeB, pafA, and pafB) encoding protein antigens. Physical maps of the phages were generated and the products of the recombinant genes were analyzed by immunoblotting techniques. PaeA and PaeB are distinct proteins but were shown to share an epitope. A similar condition was observed between PafA and PafB. Among the phages isolated, two groups expressed epitopes specific for M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis BCG. One group of phages produced an antigenic determinant which is found in M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium marinum but not in M. bovis BCG.",1988
s53307,presentation and immunogenicity of the hepatitis b surface antigen and a poliovirus neutralization antigen on mixed empty envelope particles.,"presentation and immunogenicity of the hepatitis b surface antigen and a poliovirus neutralization antigen on mixed empty envelope particles.. Insertion of a synthetic DNA fragment encoding a poliovirus neutralization epitope into the S gene encoding the major envelope protein of hepatitis B virus has yielded hybrid (HBsPolioAg) particles closely resembling authentic 22-nm antigen (HBsAg) particles by expression of the modified gene in mammalian cells. In mice, these hybrid particles induce neutralizing antibodies against poliovirus but only weak immune response to HBsAg (F. Delpeyroux, N. Chenciner, A. Lim, Y. Malpiece, B. Blondel, R. Crainic, S. Van der Werf, and R. E. Streeck, Science 233:472-474, 1986). By cotransfection with different plasmids carrying either modified or unmodified S genes, we have now obtained mixed particles presenting both HBsAg and HBsPolioAg. When such particles were inoculated into rabbits, antibodies to both poliovirus and to HBsAg were induced. Moreover, the titers of neutralizing antibodies to poliovirus induced by HBsPolioAg were much higher than those previously obtained in mice. The design of multivalent particles carrying various peptide sequences or presenting several heterologous epitopes may therefore be possible.",1988
s53372,gene transfer of the ly-3 chain gene of the mouse cd8 molecular complex: co-transfer with the ly-2 polypeptide gene results in detectable cell surface expression of the ly-3 antigenic determinants.,"gene transfer of the ly-3 chain gene of the mouse cd8 molecular complex: co-transfer with the ly-2 polypeptide gene results in detectable cell surface expression of the ly-3 antigenic determinants.. The CD8 molecule is a glycoprotein expressed on a subset of mature T lymphocytes. It has been postulated to be a receptor for class I major histocompatibility complex molecules. In the mouse, CD8 is a heterodimer composed of Ly-2 and Ly-3 chains. We have isolated and analyzed cDNA and cosmid clones corresponding to the Ly-3 subunit. One of the isolated, cosmid clones was subsequently transfected, alone or in combination with the Ly-2 gene, into mouse Ltk- cells. Analysis of the Ly-2,3 molecules expressed at the surface of the double transfectants indicated that they are serologically and biochemically indistinguishable from their normal counterparts expressed on lymphoid cells. Ltk- cells transfected with the Ly-2 gene alone were shown to react with a subset of anti-CD8 monoclonal antibodies whereas Ly-3 transfectants did not stain with any of the anti-Ly-3 antibodies employed in this study. Since at least one of these antibodies (53-5.8) has been previously shown to recognize an epitope which is retained on the Ly-3 subunit after dissociation of the heterodimeric Ly-2,3 complex, these observations suggest that the expression of the Ly-2 polypeptide is required to permit the detectable cell surface expression of the antigenic determinants carried by the Ly-3 subunit.",1988
s53406,use of recombinant antigens expressed in escherichia coli k-12 to map b-cell and t-cell epitopes on the immunodominant 65-kilodalton protein of mycobacterium bovis bcg.,"use of recombinant antigens expressed in escherichia coli k-12 to map b-cell and t-cell epitopes on the immunodominant 65-kilodalton protein of mycobacterium bovis bcg.. In gene libraries of Mycobacterium bovis BCG, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Mycobacterium leprae, recombinants were frequently encountered that expressed an immunodominant 65-kilodalton (kDa) protein antigen that was shown to react with a high proportion of mycobacterium-reactive human and murine T cells and murine monoclonal antibodies. In this study, recombinant antigens were used to map T-cell and B-cell epitopes on the M. bovis BCG 65-kDa protein that was previously designated MbaA. Four different T-cell-epitope-containing regions (amino acid residues 1 through 16, 17 through 61, 85 through 108, and 235 through 279) were defined that were recognized by seven T-cell clones from patients with tuberculoid leprosy. These regions are distinct from two previously described T-cell epitopes recognized by T cells from a tuberculosis patient. As T-cell clones restricted by different class II determinants were shown to be specific for different regions on the 65-kDa protein, the presented data suggested that the products of different human leukocyte antigen class II loci and alleles present different parts of MbaA to the immune system. B-cell epitopes recognized by 20 monoclonal antibodies were assigned to eight different regions of MbaA. Using 15 of these antibodies, we previously showed that MbaA was antigenically related to a common antigen present in many bacterial species. The dispersed localization of the involved epitopes defined here shows that various different parts of MbaA are indeed conserved. These results show that well-defined recombinant antigens are useful tools for the localization of both B- and T-cell-epitope-containing regions of a protein. Peptides synthesized from the sequences of such regions may then exactly define the epitopes relevant for the development of specific diagnostic tests or of vaccines against mycobacteria.",1988
s53429,mapping antigenic domains expressed by chlamydia trachomatis major outer membrane protein genes.,"mapping antigenic domains expressed by chlamydia trachomatis major outer membrane protein genes.. Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate prokaryotic intracellular pathogen of humans that infects mucosal epithelial cells. Exposed domains of its major outer membrane protein (MOMP) are both serotyping and protective antigenic determinants. To identify these domains, we have cloned and epitope-mapped the genes of serovars A, C (C serogroup) and L2, B (B serogroup) with a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Predominantly conserved regions of the genes of both serogroups are interspersed with four short variable domains (I-IV). Recombinant phage clones expressing specific MOMP antigenic determinants revealed that protective serotype-specific recognized epitopes in variable domains I and II. Protective subspecies and serogroup-specific mAbs recognized overlapping determinants in variable domain IV near the C terminus. A nonprotective species-specific mAb mapped to an invariant peptide of nine residues contained within variable domain IV. In the intact chlamydial organism of serovar B, variable domains II and IV were susceptible to proteolytic digestion, whereas both N and C termini were protected. These results suggest an arrangement of MOMP in the outer membrane in which three of the four variable domains are exposed to the outside and in which both N and C termini are presumably oriented toward the periplasmic space. This molecular analysis of MOMP antigenic determinants and their surface topology on intact chlamydiae will be useful toward the development of a recombinant subunit or synthetic chlamydial vaccine.",1988
s53478,the antigenic index: a novel algorithm for predicting antigenic determinants.,"the antigenic index: a novel algorithm for predicting antigenic determinants.. In this paper, we introduce a computer algorithm which can be used to predict the topological features of a protein directly from its primary amino acid sequence. The computer program generates values for surface accessibility parameters and combines these values with those obtained for regional backbone flexibility and predicted secondary structure. The output of this algorithm, the antigenic index, is used to create a linear surface contour profile of the protein. Because most, if not all, antigenic sites are located within surface exposed regions of a protein, the program offers a reliable means of predicting potential antigenic determinants. We have tested the ability of this program to generate accurate surface contour profiles and predict antigenic sites from the linear amino acid sequences of well-characterized proteins and found a strong correlation between the predictions of the antigenic index and known structural and biological data.",1988
s53519,identification of a region in the s1 subunit of pertussis toxin that is required for enzymatic activity and that contributes to the formation of a neutralizing antigenic determinant.,"identification of a region in the s1 subunit of pertussis toxin that is required for enzymatic activity and that contributes to the formation of a neutralizing antigenic determinant.. The S1 subunit of pertussis toxin possesses two regions (homology boxes), each spanning 8 residues, that are nearly identical in sequence to similarly located regions in the enzymatically active A fragments of two other ADP-ribosylating toxins: cholera toxin and Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin. This observation suggests a functional role for one or both of these regions in enzymatic activity. We have examined the role of one of these regions, located near the amino terminus of the S1 subunit, by using a high-level recombinant expression system and progressive truncation of the gene sequence encoding the amino terminus of the molecule. A series of six truncated, recombinant proteins were produced at high levels in E. coli and examined for their enzymatic and antigenic properties. The three molecules that lacked most or all of the homology box delimited by amino acid residues 8 and 15 lacked detectable enzymatic activity. All of the three molecules in which the box was retained exhibited detectable activity. Only those recombinant molecules that possessed the homology box reacted with a neutralizing and passively protective monoclonal anti-S1 antibody. These findings identify the region of homology located near the amino terminus of S1 as an apparent enzymatic subsite and a potentially important antigenic determinant.",1988
s53560,genetic control and properties of coli surface antigens of colonization factor antigen iv (pcf8775) of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli.,"genetic control and properties of coli surface antigens of colonization factor antigen iv (pcf8775) of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli.. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli producing coli surface antigen 4 (CS4), CS5, and CS6 of colonization factor antigen IV were examined. This factor was originally called putative colonization factor 8775 (PCF8775). All of the coli surface antigens were plasmid coded and were usually carried on the same plasmid as the genes coding for heat-stable toxin (ST) or heat-labile toxin (LT); thus, CS5-CS6-ST, CS6-ST, and CS6-LT plasmids were found. In strains of serotype O25:H42, the genes coding for CS4 and CS6 were on a plasmid separate from that containing the genes coding for ST and LT. CS4 and CS5 were fimbrial antigens with a subunit molecular mass of about 17.0 and 21.0 kilodaltons (kDa), respectively. CS6 was found as a single polypeptide with a molecular mass of about 14.5 kDa in strains of serotypes O25:H42, O27:H7, and O27:H20 when heated extracts were run on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. CS6-positive extracts of strains of serogroups O148, O159, and O167 showed two bands with molecular masses between 14.5 and 16.0 kDa.",1988
s53573,human t cell response to the surface antigen of hepatitis b virus (hbsag). endosomal and nonendosomal processing pathways are accessible to both endogenous and exogenous antigen.,"human t cell response to the surface antigen of hepatitis b virus (hbsag). endosomal and nonendosomal processing pathways are accessible to both endogenous and exogenous antigen.. We have studied the antigen specificity and processing requirements of three vaccine-induced cloned human T cell lines specific for HBsAg, the envelope protein of hepatitis B virus. Each T cell line recognized endogenously expressed antigen as well as exogenous antigen. Two clones required endosomal processing, both for exogenous and endogenous antigen; while the other T cell line depended on nonendosomal processing to generate antigenic peptides from both endogenous and exogenous antigen. Thus, the two processing pathways are accessible to exogenous and endogenous antigen. These results suggest that vaccine-induced T cells can participate actively in the immune response to live virus.",1988
s53575,influences of antigen processing on the expression of the t cell repertoire. evidence for mhc-specific hindering structures on the products of processing.,"influences of antigen processing on the expression of the t cell repertoire. evidence for mhc-specific hindering structures on the products of processing.. Two lines of evidence in the current study indicate that antigen processing is a major factor, in addition to MHC binding and T cell repertoire, that determines Ir gene responsiveness and epitope immunodominance. First, immunization with synthetic peptides of myoglobin sequences revealed new reactivities that had not appeared after priming with native myoglobin. For example, B10.S mice (H-2S) immune to equine myoglobin predominantly responded to peptide 102-118, whereas there was little, if any, response to this peptide in B10.BR (H-2k) mice immunized with native equine myoglobin. However, after immunization with the 102-118 peptide, both strains responded to the peptide. After in vitro restimulation, B10.BR T cells responded as well as B10.S T cells. Similarly, some individual 102-118-specific T cell clones from mice of both haplotypes showed similar dose responses and fine specificity patterns. Thus, low responsiveness to this site is due neither to a hole in the repertoire nor to a failure to bind to the appropriate MHC molecule. An alternative explanation was suggested by the observation that, whereas B10.S T cells from peptide 102-118-immune mice responded almost as well to whole myoglobin as to the peptide, the B10.BR T cells from peptide immune mice, while responding well to peptide, were poorly stimulated by whole myoglobin. Thus, the product of natural processing of equine myoglobin probably has hindering structures in the regions flanking the core epitope 102-118 that interfere with presentation by I-Ak but not I-AS. The second line of evidence that processing of native myoglobin may influence the apparent specificity of the T cell response was obtained using the I-Ad-restricted sperm whale myoglobin 102-118-specific clone 9.27. This clone discriminated readily between whole sperm whale myoglobin and equine myoglobin, but it did not distinguish between peptides corresponding to 102-118 of the sperm whale and equine sequences. This distinction between equine peptide and native equine myoglobin could be overcome by artificial """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""processing"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" of equine myoglobin with cyanogen bromide. In both sets of experiments, F1 APCs that present the same epitope well to T cells of another haplotype failed to overcome the defect, which was therefore not due to the availability of different processed cleavage fragments in APC of different haplotypes, as would be expected if there were MHC-linked processing. Thus, the differential responses to peptides versus native molecule for both I-Ad- and I-Ak-restricted clones appeared to depend on the restricting molecule used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1988
s53580,characterization of antigen-expressing plasmodium falciparum cdna clones that are reactive with parasite inhibitory antibodies.,"characterization of antigen-expressing plasmodium falciparum cdna clones that are reactive with parasite inhibitory antibodies.. A Plasmodium falciparum (FCR3 strain) lambda gt11 cDNA expression library was constructed from trophozoite and schizont poly(A) RNA and was screened immunologically with a pooled human immune serum from Nigeria to form a gene bank of 288 positive clones. The gene bank was subsequently screened with parasite inhibitory mouse monoclonal antibodies (mMAb) and with individual human Liberian sera. Two mMAb, 43E5 and 5H10, strongly reacted with 8 and 3 cDNA clones, respectively. Several of those clones also weakly cross-reacted with the other mMAb. Two of those weakly cross-reactive clones, cDNA#366 and cDNA#22, were shown to be located in different chromosomal regions of the parasite by Southern hybridization and so appeared to represent two different parasite genes. The genomic organization of both cDNA#366 and cDNA#22 sequences were identical in the FCR3 and the Honduras-1 strain. The nucleotide sequence of cDNA#366 and the amino acid sequence it coded for were homologous to a partial DNA and amino acid sequence previously reported for a P. falciparum (Camp strain) exoantigen designated p126. The mRNA for cDNA#366 appeared to represent an abundant message in blood stage trophozoites and schizonts.",1988
s53690,site-specific mutations in vectors that express antigenic and temperature-sensitive phenotypes of the m gene of vesicular stomatitis virus.,"site-specific mutations in vectors that express antigenic and temperature-sensitive phenotypes of the m gene of vesicular stomatitis virus.. Full-length cDNA copies of mRNAs coding for the matrix (M) proteins of vesicular stomatitis virus and its mutant tsO23(III) were cloned in pBSM13- (BlueScribe). The authenticity of these clones was demonstrated by restriction enzyme mapping, DNA sequencing, and in vitro transcription and translation to identify the two M proteins by Western immunoblotting with epitope-specific monoclonal antibodies. Site-directed mutants were constructed by primer extension of synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides with one or two nucleotide changes to alter the glycine at amino acid 21 of the wild-type (wt) M gene to glutamic acid, alanine, or proline. Similarly, a revertant was created in the M gene of mutant tsO23 by a Glu-21----Gly substitution. A series of wt- and mutant-M-gene chimeras was also constructed to create mutant and revertant clones with Leu----Phe and His----Tyr alterations at amino acids 111 and 227, respectively. We then moved the wt and tsO23 M genes and their site-specific mutants and chimeras cloned in pBSM13- into the eucaryotic expression vector pTF7 directed by the T7 bacteriophage RNA polymerase of the vaccinia virus recombinant vTF1-6,2. Western blot analysis of the M proteins transiently expressed in CV-1 cells by plasmids carrying M genes altered at amino acid 21 revealed that the critical antigenic determinant (epitope 1) is expressed only by the Gly-21 M protein and not by Glu-21, Ala-21, or Pro-21 M proteins. Of particular interest is an apparent conformational change, evidenced by slightly but significantly retarded electrophoretic migration, in plasmid-expressed M proteins with amino acids substituted for glycine at position 21. The glutamic acid at position 21 of tsO23 is not responsible for its temperature-sensitive phenotype, because a tsO23 revertant plasmid with glycine substituted at position 21 fails to rescue tsO23 virus in cells infected at the restrictive temperature; conversely, plasmids expressing wt M protein with substitutions of glutamic acid, alanine, or proline at position 21 are just as effective in marker rescue of tsO23 as is the Gly-21 wt M protein. Marker rescue experiments with wt- and mutant-M-gene chimeras support the hypothesis of K. Morita, R. Vanderoef, and J. Lenard (J. Virol. 61:256-263, 1987) that the temperature-sensitive phenotype of tsO23 is due to a phenylalanine substituted for leucine at amino acid 111, rather than the His-227----Tyr substitution or the Gly-21----Glu substitution, which independently accounts for the loss of epitope 1 in the mutant M protein of tsO23.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1988
s53719,characterization of purified hepatitis b surface antigen containing pre-s(2) epitopes expressed in saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"characterization of purified hepatitis b surface antigen containing pre-s(2) epitopes expressed in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. The cloning and expression of the hepatitis B middle-protein surface antigen gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is described. A generalized expression vector carrying the yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene promoter was used. Expressed material, in the form of supramolecular particles, was purified and characterized. Severe proteolysis within the pre-S(2) region was observed for material expressed in a wild-type yeast host. This proteolysis was substantially reduced by utilization of a protease-deficient host. Immunoblotting of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels with several antibodies of differing specificity was performed to characterize the various protein species present. All species were analyzed by N-terminal sequencing after electroelution from gels. Carbohydrate staining of gels and glycosidase treatments of the purified antigen material indicated that full-length antigen was present in both glycosylated and unglycosylated forms. Glycosylation appeared to be of both asparagine-linked and threonine/serine-linked types. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to convert two arginine residues in the pre-S(2) region of the antigen to glutamine residues. The changes abolished reactivity with one polyclonal and two monoclonal antibodies specific for epitopes within the pre-S(2) region.",1988
s53722,shigella flexneri invasion plasmid antigens b and c: epitope location and characterization with monoclonal antibodies.,"shigella flexneri invasion plasmid antigens b and c: epitope location and characterization with monoclonal antibodies.. Invasion plasmid antigens B (IpaB) and C (IpaC) are associated with the ability of shigellae to invade cultured mammalian cells. Monoclonal antibodies against IpaB and IpaC polypeptides were produced and used in a whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to show that both IpaB and IpaC polypeptides were exposed on the surface of virulent shigellae. Moreover, these surface epitopes were shown to be highly conserved among different serotypes of Shigella spp. and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli. Cross-reactive epitopes were not found on noninvasive Shigella strains or on other enteric bacteria including Salmonella, Yersinia, Campylobacter, Vibrio, and Aeromonas spp. and various pathogenic strains of E. coli. The monoclonal antibodies were used in competitive binding assays to define three unique epitopes of the IpaB polypeptide and four unique epitopes of the IpaC polypeptide. Epitope locations and their corresponding DNA-encoding regions were defined by examining the IpaB and IpaC products expressed by lambda gt11 recombinants and by constructing a genetic map of the insert DNAs of these recombinants. Three IpaB epitopes (2F1, 1H4, 4C8) were found to be encoded on three contiguous DNA regions comprising a 700-base-pair (bp) segment that corresponded to the amino-terminal end of the IpaB polypeptide. Similarly, a 640-bp DNA segment that corresponded to the amino-terminal end of the IpaC polypeptide was found to encode three clustered IpaC epitopes (5H1, 9B6, 5B1). Approximately 50 bp downstream from this region a fourth IpaC epitope-encoding region (2G2) was found. The effect of the monoclonal antibodies on plaque formation by virulent Shigella flexneri on a monolayer of cultured mammalian cells (a sensitive measure of invasiveness) was determined. Only the IpaB-specific monoclonal antibody 2F1 was able to reduce the plaque-forming capacity by greater than 50%, suggesting that this epitope of the IpaB polypeptide is involved in the invasion process.",1988
s53742,development of an antigen-specific cd8 suppressor effector clone in man.,"development of an antigen-specific cd8 suppressor effector clone in man.. A long-term cultured IL-2-dependent keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)-specific CD8 (T8) suppressor clone (5B9) was generated from a healthy donor hyperimmunized with KLH. The 5B9 clonal population suppressed in vitro anti-KLH antibody response but did not suppress anti-TT antibody response or PWM-driven IgG synthesis. Moreover, 5B9 cells could not suppress anti-TT antibody response even in the presence of free KLH. 5B9 cloned cells suppressed the anti-KLH antibody response of B cells cultured with CD4+4B4+ cells without requiring the presence of CD8+ cells. This KLH-specific CD8 suppressor clone is an effector type rather than an inducer type of suppressor T cell. The cloned cells expressed alpha- and beta-TCR proteins (defined by WT-31 antibody) on their cell surface. More importantly, the CD3:TCR complex was functionally important in the suppression induced by this clone, because after CD3 antigen modulation from its cell surface, the suppressor effector function was abolished.",1988
s53745,glycosylation of a vh residue of a monoclonal antibody against alpha (1----6) dextran increases its affinity for antigen.,"glycosylation of a vh residue of a monoclonal antibody against alpha (1----6) dextran increases its affinity for antigen.. We have observed that antidextran hybridomas with potential N-linked glycosylation sites in VH have higher affinity for polymeric dextran and for isomaltoheptaose than those lacking potential glycosylation sites. In these studies we have used gene transfection and expression techniques to verify that the carbohydrate addition sites in VH were used. The carbohydrate of the VH region was accessible for binding by the lectin Con A. By ELISA analysis it was demonstrated that the aKa of the antibody for dextran was influenced by the presence of carbohydrate in VH, with the aglycosylated antibody having an aKa 15-fold lower than its untreated counterpart. The aKa for antigen of antibodies that contain carbohydrate only in their constant region was unaffected by lack of carbohydrate. Thus, not only the amino acid sequence of the variable region but also its carbohydrate moieties can determine the magnitude of the antigen-antibody interaction.",1988
s53761,a herpesvirus vector for expression of glycosylated membrane antigens: fusion proteins of pseudorabies virus giii and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 envelope glycoproteins.,"a herpesvirus vector for expression of glycosylated membrane antigens: fusion proteins of pseudorabies virus giii and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 envelope glycoproteins.. We describe experiments using the swine herpesvirus, pseudorabies virus (PRV), as a vector for expression of hybrid membrane protein genes. In particular, we present the construction and analysis of three infectious PRV mutants expressing chimeric viral membrane proteins composed of portions of the PRV envelope glycoprotein gIII and of the human retrovirus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41. All of the chimeric genes contain the transcription control sequences and the first 157 codons of PRV gIII (known to contain signals sufficient for efficient export of the encoded peptide out of the cell) fused to different regions of the HIV-1 envelope. The mutant viruses express novel glycosylated fusion proteins that are immunoprecipitated by polyvalent sera specific for gIII, as well as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patient sera. The levels of expression are lower than expected due primarily to instability or altered processing of the hybrid mRNA. We could not detect cleavage of chimeric proteins carrying the gp120-gp41 protease processing site. The use of localization signals contained within herpesvirus membrane proteins to direct chimeric proteins to desired cellular locations is discussed.",1988
s53827,construction of antigen-specific suppressor t cell hybridomas from spleen cells of mice primed for the persistent ige antibody formation.,"construction of antigen-specific suppressor t cell hybridomas from spleen cells of mice primed for the persistent ige antibody formation.. Attempts were made to generate Ag-specific suppressor T cells from Ag-primed spleen cells by using glycosylation inhibiting factor (GIF). BDF1 mice were primed with alum-absorbed OVA and their spleen cells were stimulated with OVA. Ag-activated T cells were then propagated in IL-2-containing conditioned medium. Incubation of the T cells with OVA-pulsed syngeneic macrophages resulted in the formation of IgE-potentiating factor and glycosylation-enhancing factor that has affinity for OVA, i.e., OVA-specific glycosylation-enhancing factor. However, if the same Ag-activated splenic T cells were propagated in the IL-2-containing medium in the presence of GIF T cells obtained in the cultures formed IgE-suppressive factors and OVA-specific GIF on antigenic stimulation. Thus we constructed T cell hybridomas from the Ag-activated T cells propagated by IL-2 in the presence of GIF. A representative hybridoma, 71B4, formed OVA-specific GIF on incubation with OVA-pulsed macrophages of BDF1 mice or C57B1/6 mice. However, if the same hybridoma cells were incubated with OVA alone or with OVA-pulsed macrophages of H-2k or H-2d strains, they produced GIF that had no affinity for OVA. The OVA-specific GIF bound to OVA-Sepharose but did not bind to BSA-Sepharose or KLH Sepharose. Intravenous injections of the OVA-specific GIF from the hybridoma suppressed the IgE and IgG1 anti-DNP antibody response of BDF1 mice to DNP-OVA, but failed to suppress the anti-hapten antibody responses of the strain to DNP-keyhole limpet hemocyanin, indicating that the factors suppressed the antibody response in a carrier-specific manner. However, the same OVA-specific GIF failed to suppress the anti-hapten antibody response of DBA/1 mice to DNP-OVA, suggesting that the immunosuppressive effects of the factors is MHC restricted.",1988
s53960,recognition of oligonucleotide-encoded t cell epitopes introduced into a gene unrelated to the original antigen.,recognition of oligonucleotide-encoded t cell epitopes introduced into a gene unrelated to the original antigen.. We have previously demonstrated that H-2Kd-restricted CTL specific for HLA-CW3 or HLA-A24 can recognize synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 170-182 of the HLA molecules. Synthetic oligonucleotides encoding region 170-182 of CW3 or A24 were inserted into the influenza nucleoprotein (NP) gene. We demonstrate herein that P815 (H-2d) cells transfected with the NP-oligo recombinant genes are specifically lysed by HLA-specific Kd-restricted CTL clones. Our results imply that there must be a high degree of flexibility for the expression of T cell epitopes in different molecular contexts.,1989
s53962,modulation of hla class ii antigen expression by transfection of sense and antisense dr alpha cdna.,"modulation of hla class ii antigen expression by transfection of sense and antisense dr alpha cdna.. In the human there are three isotypic forms of MHC class II gene products (HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP). The isotype-matched alpha-beta dimers are predominant but isotype-mismatched dimers can also be expressed (DR alpha-DQ beta). Here it is shown that the expression of the DR alpha-DQ beta dimer can be correlated to a high ratio of DR alpha/DR beta mRNA. The DR alpha chain expression was modulated by transfection of a sense and antisense DR alpha cDNA. Overexpression of DR alpha promoted the appearance of the DR alpha-DQ beta dimer. On the other hand, pre-existing DR alpha-DQ beta dimer expression was suppressed after antisense DR alpha cDNA transfection. Therefore, imbalanced expression of the alpha and beta chain from a given isotype could lead to the modification of HLA class II phenotype.",1989
s54005,antigenic determinants and functional domains in core antigen and e antigen from hepatitis b virus.,"antigenic determinants and functional domains in core antigen and e antigen from hepatitis b virus.. The precore/core gene of hepatitis B virus directs the synthesis of two polypeptides, the 21-kilodalton subunit (p21c) forming the viral nucleocapsid (serologically defined as core antigen [HBcAg]) and a secreted processed protein (p17e, serologically defined as HBe antigen [HBeAg]). Although most of their primary amino acid sequences are identical, HBcAg and HBeAg display different antigenic properties that are widely used in hepatitis B virus diagnosis. To locate and to characterize the corresponding determinants, segments of the core gene were expressed in Escherichia coli and probed with a panel of polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies in radioimmunoassays or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, Western blots, and competition assays. Three distinct major determinants were characterized. The single conformational determinant responsible for HBc antigenicity in the assembled core (HBc) and a linear HBe-related determinant (HBe1) were both mapped to an overlapping hydrophilic sequence around amino acid 80; a second HBe determinant (HBe2) was assigned to a location in the vicinity of amino acid 138 but found to require for its antigenicity the intramolecular participation of the extended sequence between amino acids 10 and 140. It is postulated that HBcAg and HBeAg share common basic three-dimensional structure exposing the common linear determinant HBe1 but that they differ in the presentation of two conformational determinants that are either introduced (HBc) or masked (HBe2) in the assembled core. The simultaneous presentation of HBe1 and HBc, two distinctly different antigenic determinants with overlapping amino acid sequences, is interpreted to indicate the presence of slightly differently folded, stable conformational states of p21c in the hepatitis B virus nucleocapsid.",1989
s54045,induction of tumor-specific in vivo protective immunity by immunization with tumor antigen-pulsed antigen-presenting cells.,"induction of tumor-specific in vivo protective immunity by immunization with tumor antigen-pulsed antigen-presenting cells.. The present study investigates the role of APC in inducing tumor-specific in vivo protective immunity. Thy-1+ cell-depleted, Mac-1+ cell-enriched fraction of normal BALB/c spleen cells were used as a source of APC. These APC were cultured in vitro with the membrane fraction isolated from CSA1M fibrosarcoma derived from BALB/c strain. The administration of such APC into naive BALB/c mice generated the capacity of these animals to reject the subsequently challenged viable CSA1M tumor cells. Although the induction of anti-CSA1M in vivo protective immunity required three consecutive immunizations with more than 10(5) APC which had been pulsed in vitro with 200 to 300 micrograms protein of CSA1M membrane fraction, the immunity was induced irrespective of whether APC were administered via s.c., i.v., or i.p. route. This immunity was tumor-specific, inasmuch as the inoculation of CSA1M or Meth A fibrosarcoma membrane component-pulsed APC resulted in the selective immunity against the challenge with homologous types of tumor cells. The CSA1M-specific in vivo protective immunity was also induced by injecting APC pulsed with solubilized CSA1M membrane components. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the efficiency for inducing anti-CSA1M immunity was much higher in the utilization of tumor Ag-pulsed APC than in the immunization with tumor Ag emulsified in CFA. These results indicate the critical role of APC in generating tumor rejection immunity in vivo and this model presents a novel approach to induce tumor-specific immunity without using tumor cells themselves.",1989
s54056,a hybrid gene to express protein epitopes from both sporozoite and merozoite surface antigens of plasmodium falciparum.,"a hybrid gene to express protein epitopes from both sporozoite and merozoite surface antigens of plasmodium falciparum.. The DNA coding for parts of the repetitive amino acid sequence of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein has been spliced to a sequence encoding part of the precursor to the major merozoite surface antigens, to produce a hybrid gene. Expression in Escherichia coli produces a protein with antigenic determinants from both malaria proteins. Antibodies raised against the expressed material react with both a peptide derived from the circumsporozoite repeat sequence, and the merozoite surface molecule. Hybrid molecules of this type may be the basis of a malaria vaccine.",1988
s54131,a pentapeptide as minimal antigenic determinant for mhc class i-restricted t lymphocytes.,"a pentapeptide as minimal antigenic determinant for mhc class i-restricted t lymphocytes.. Peptides that are antigenic for T lymphocytes are ligands for two receptors, the class I or II glycoproteins that are encoded by genes in the major histocompatibility complex, and the idiotypic alpha/beta chain T-cell antigen receptor. That a peptide must bind to an MHC molecule to interact with a T-cell antigen receptor is the molecular basis of the MHC restriction of antigen-recognition by T lymphocytes. In such a trimolecular interaction the amino-acid sequence of the peptide must specify the contact with both receptors: agretope residues bind to the MHC receptor and epitope residues bind to the T-cell antigen receptor. From a compilation of known antigenic peptides, two algorithms have been proposed to predict antigenic sites in proteins. One algorithm uses linear motifs in the sequence, whereas the other considers peptide conformation and predicts antigenicity for amphipathic alpha-helices. We report here that a systematic delimitation of an antigenic site precisely identifies a predicted pentapeptide motif as the minimal antigenic determinant presented by a class I MHC molecule and recognized by a cytolytic T lymphocyte clone.",1989
s54192,characterization of the prostate-specific antigen gene: a novel human kallikrein-like gene.,characterization of the prostate-specific antigen gene: a novel human kallikrein-like gene.. Using Prostate-specific Antigen cDNA fragments as hybridization probes a clone containing the information for the gene encoding Prostate-specific Antigen was isolated form a human genomic DNA library. The complete gene (about 6 kb) was sequenced and shown to be composed of four introns and five exons. Two major transcription initiation sites were found. The sequence of the promoter region revealed the presence of various well known transcription regulatory elements including a TATA box. A high percentage of homology was found between the Prostate-specific Antigen gene and the hGK-1 gene (82%). This homology extended into the promoter region. Two previously described variant Prostate-specific Antigen cDNAs can now be explained by intron retention and alternative splicing of the primary transcript.,1989
s54237,hepatitis b virus surface antigen (hbsag) as carrier for synthetic peptides having an attached hydrophobic tail.,"hepatitis b virus surface antigen (hbsag) as carrier for synthetic peptides having an attached hydrophobic tail.. B- and T-cell epitopes from three distinct regions of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) envelope (env) protein (preS1, preS2 and S) are involved in eliciting protective immunity. Since preS1 sequences inhibit the secretion of HBV env proteins from eukaryotic cells, it is difficult to prepare immunogens rich in preS1 sequences. This problem can be overcome by linking synthetic peptides from the preS1 region to particles containing both S and preS2 sequences. We describe here a novel approach for binding of synthetic peptides to exposed hydrophobic domains on HBV env proteins. Long chain fatty acids or mercaptans are covalently linked to synthetic peptides. Peptides with the attached hydrophobic tails interact strongly with HBV env proteins (S + preS2), whereby hybrid immunogens are generated. Such immunogens can be used in combination with alum, the only adjuvant approved for human use. The combination of the preS1 peptide [preS(12-47)] with particles containing the S and preS2 regions resulted in an immunogen which: (1) elicits a broad spectrum of protective antibodies; (2) circumvents the nonresponsiveness to: (a) preS1 epitopes in preS1-nonresponder strains of mice; and (b) S-protein in S-protein-nonresponder strains of mice; and (3) augments the immune response to S-protein. The combination of HBV env proteins with a synthetic peptide from the envelope of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) resulted in an immunogen eliciting anti-HIV-1. Hybrid immunogens consisting of viral proteins and of synthetic peptides represent a feasible approach for the design of future vaccines.",1989
s54238,antigenicity of the peplomer protein of infectious bronchitis virus.,"antigenicity of the peplomer protein of infectious bronchitis virus.. To study the antigenic structure of the peplomer protein of the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus, fragments from the peplomer gene were generated by restriction-enzyme cleavage or by limited DNase digestion and inserted in the Escherichia coli expression plasmid pEX (Stanley and Luzio, 1984). The antigenicity of the expression products was tested using a number of polyclonal antisera and monoclonal antibodies. The polyclonal antisera recognized different sets of epitopes in the 1162-residue sequence. The N-terminal region of one of the two subunits, S2, was recognized by all polyclonal sera and by two monoclonal antibodies. This clearly immunodominant region contains at least two adjacent or overlapping epitopes, one of which has been localized within 18 residues. The epitopes found as antigenic pEX expression products do not coincide with the regions in the S1 subunit that have been found to contain hypervariable sequences. We suggest that these regions constitute conformation dependent neutralization epitopes that cannot be detected in the pEX system. The relevance of our findings for vaccine development is discussed.",1989
s54299,the prostate-specific antigen gene and the human glandular kallikrein-1 gene are tandemly located on chromosome 19.,"the prostate-specific antigen gene and the human glandular kallikrein-1 gene are tandemly located on chromosome 19.. Using a prostate-specific antigen cDNA as a hybridization probe, clones containing the kallikrein genes encoding prostate-specific antigen, human glandular kallikrein-1 and pancreas/kidney kallikrein were isolated from a human genomic library. Clones containing the prostate-specific antigen gene and the human glandular kallikrein-1 gene overlap and span a region of about 36 kb. The two genes are aligned in a head to tail orientation at a mutual distance of 12 kb. Southern blot analysis of DNA from a panel of human-hamster hybrid cells with specific probes revealed the genes to be situated on chromosome 19. Assuming that the pancreas/kidney kallikrein gene is located in the same cluster, the distance to the prostate-specific antigen gene and the human glandular kallikrein gene must be at least 15 kb.",1989
s54352,antigen recognition by class i-restricted t lymphocytes.,antigen recognition by class i-restricted t lymphocytes.. The work discussed here offers a unified view of T-cell recognition and suggests that class-I and class-II molecules have a closely related function in the presentation of peptides to T lymphocytes. The epitopes recognized by class I-restricted T cells that have been defined with peptides in the 4-6 hr lysis assay have all been derived from endogenously synthesized proteins expressed by virus infected or transfected cells. Evidence is accumulating that a cytoplasmic degradation system may be involved in the generation of these epitopes. The analysis of the specificity of CTL responses with synthetic peptides has demonstrated the control of immune responses to isolated epitopes by class-I genes and the great diversity of the receptor repertoire for individual class-I-restricted epitopes.,1989
s54390,cloning of the rfb gene region of shigella dysenteriae 1 and construction of an rfb-rfp gene cassette for the development of lipopolysaccharide-based live anti-dysentery vaccines.,"cloning of the rfb gene region of shigella dysenteriae 1 and construction of an rfb-rfp gene cassette for the development of lipopolysaccharide-based live anti-dysentery vaccines.. Recent studies have shown that determinants for the production of O antigen lipopolysaccharide in Shigella dysenteriae 1 are distributed over two distinct genetic elements, the chromosome and a 9 kb plasmid designated pHW400. In this communication, we describe the cloning of all determinants necessary for S. dysenteriae 1 O antigen production in E. coli K-12 and their combination in a single plasmid. An RP4::miniMu R-prime plasmid, R-prime 40, containing the his-rfb (histidine biosynthesis-lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis) gene region of the Shigella dysenteriae 1 chromosome was generated. E. coli K-12 bacteria containing R-prime 40 and pSS8, a transposon Tn5-tagged derivative of pHW400, produced lipopolysaccharide indistinguishable from that of S. dysenteriae 1. Small DNA fragments containing the rfb gene cluster and the rfp gene were subcloned from R-prime 40 and pSS8 and subsequently combined in vector pACYC184 to produce pSS37. This latter plasmid when introduced by transformation into E. coli K-12 provoked the formation of S. dysenteriae 1 O-specific lipopolysaccharide, a feature that suggests it may be useful in the construction of LPS-based live vaccines against the Shiga bacillus.",1986
s54391,genetic and biochemical analysis of shigella dysenteriae 1 o antigen polysaccharide biosynthesis in escherichia coli k-12: structure and functions of the rfb gene cluster.,"genetic and biochemical analysis of shigella dysenteriae 1 o antigen polysaccharide biosynthesis in escherichia coli k-12: structure and functions of the rfb gene cluster.. The genetic organization and functions of the Shigella dysenteriae 1 rfb gene cluster, which specifies the somatic O antigen in this organism, have been studied in Escherichia coli K-12 by insertion and deletion mutagenesis of pSS9, a pBR322 hybrid containing the Shigella rfb genes. On the basis of the sensitivity/resistance to rough-specific bacteriophage T3 of E. coli K-12 derivatives containing mutant pSS9 plasmids, of the banding patterns and immunoreactivity of LPS isolated from such derivatives and electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and of the sugar composition of the polysaccharide portion of the LPS determined by chemical analysis, six determinants for O antigen production were identified and localized. At least two determinants are involved in synthesis of TDP-rhamnose and the transfer of a rhamnose residue to the galactose-substituted core. One of these functions is probably TDP-rhamnose synthetase. A third function effects the transfer of a second rhamnose residue to the rha----gal-substituted core. A fourth function, for which evidence was obtained for two determinants (cistrons), is N-acetylglucosamine transferase, whereas a sixth determinant is necessary for extension of the first completed side chain repeat unit to the full O antigen polymer. These results confirmed the previously-determined chemical composition of the S. dysenteriae 1 O antigen and demonstrated that the order of the sugars is glcNAc----rha----rha----gal with gal as the first sugar linked to the core. Evidence was obtained for at least two transcriptional units in the rfb gene cluster and the approximate locations of two promoters are suggested. The detection of new electrophoretic species of LPS that may correspond to LPS biosynthetic intermediates, and the finding on the cell surfaces of structures corresponding to LPS core substituted with one or more O-specific sugars, appear to be novel findings.",1986

We have isolated four cDNAs encoding the entire preproprotein of prostate specific antigen from human prostatic cDNA libraries. Comparison of the coding regions of prostate specific antigen with human pancreatic kallikrein (1-3) and human glandular kallikrein (4) showed 73%-84% nucleotide and 61-77% amino acid homologies, respectively, between these enzymes. Also the 3' noncoding regions of these genes were conserved. The close resemblance of prostate specific antigen, a marker for prostatic cancer, to glandular kallikrein suggests related immunogenic properties for them.",1989

A large cell malignancy identified as a B-lymphoma only by virtue of mu and kappa chain gene rearrangement additionally displayed profuse plasmalemma marking with anti-epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). Affinity absorption of the antibody with N-acetyl-galactosamine but not with N-acetylglucosamine or d-galactose effectively removed the lymphoma reactive antibodies. Soy bean agglutinin but not wheat germ agglutinin demonstrated lectin activity towards an epitope on the lymphoma membrane. Finally, digestion of cryostat sections of the lymphoma with N-acetylgalactosaminidase effectively removed the sugar epitope involved in EMA marking.

The monoclonal antibody 5C10/66 was shown to afford strong protection in mice against fulminating Plasmodium chabaudi adami infection. This was remarkable, as immunity to this organism is regarded to be mainly T-cell mediated. This antibody identified a 250-kDa molecule in schizonts and an 83-kDa fragment in merozoites. A cDNA clone selected by 5C10/66 was the homologue of the Plasmodium falciparum precursor to the major merozoite surface antigen (PMMSA). Comparison with the P. falciparum sequence showed that the P. chabaudi adami clone encoded the middle portion of the gene and that it can also be divided into variable and conserved blocks. Screening of a set of all possible octamer peptides predicted by the cDNA clone revealed that the core epitope of 5C10/66 was Glu-Thr-Thr-Glu-Thr. This region resides in a variable block of PMMSA.",1989
s54501,expression of measles virus nucleoprotein in escherichia coli: use of deletion mutants to locate the antigenic sites.,"expression of measles virus nucleoprotein in escherichia coli: use of deletion mutants to locate the antigenic sites.. Three distinct antigenic determinants on the nucleoprotein (NP) of measles virus were localized. These epitopes were defined by three monoclonal antibodies, one of which recognized all measles virus field strains examined, whereas the other two were variable. A measles virus NP cDNA subclone representing 502 of the 525 amino acids was cloned into a bacterial expression vector plasmid (pRIT) and expressed as a Protein A-NP fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The expressed protein reacted with all three monoclonal antibodies. A series of NP gene deletion was constructed in order to locate the antigenic sites. The antigenic site identified on all measles virus strains studied, which was designated site I, was located between amino acids 122 and 150. The two variable epitopes were located at the C terminus of the protein (site II at 457 to 476; site III at 519 to 525). The structural and biological implications of these observations are discussed.",1989
s54520,expression of immunogenic epitopes of hepatitis b surface antigen with hybrid flagellin proteins by a vaccine strain of salmonella.,"expression of immunogenic epitopes of hepatitis b surface antigen with hybrid flagellin proteins by a vaccine strain of salmonella.. A nonvirulent Salmonella dublin flagellin-negative, aromatic-dependent live vaccine strain has been used to express hepatitis B virus surface antigen epitopes in an immunogenic form. The envelope proteins of the virion are encoded by the S gene, which contains the pre-S1, pre-S2, and S coding regions. Synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to amino acid residues S-(122-137) and pre-S2-(120-145) were inserted in-frame into the hypervariable region of a cloned Salmonella flagellin gene, and the recombinant plasmids were introduced into a flagellin-negative aroA mutant live vaccine strain of S. dublin, SL5928. The flagellin gene was expressed in bacteria carrying the plasmids as detected by immunoblotting with anti-flagellin (H1-d) serum. Both the S and pre-S2 epitopes were detected in bacteria carrying the relevant plasmid by immunoblotting with anti-HBs (antibody to hepatitis B virus surface antigen) and anti-peptide antisera. Animals immunized intramuscularly or orally with the live recombinant bacteria developed antibodies specific to these hepatitis B virus epitopes as detected by ELISA.",1989
s54570,"characterization of the gene for prostate-specific antigen, a human glandular kallikrein.","characterization of the gene for prostate-specific antigen, a human glandular kallikrein.. The gene for the human glandular kallikrein, prostate-specific antigen, has been cloned. The sequence of 7130 nucleotides encompassing the gene and 633 bp of 5' and 639 bp of 3' flanking DNA has been determined. The translation initiation site was slightly heterogeneous, yielding 5' non-translated leader sequences of 41 and 35 bp. The gene is divided into five exons, with introns located at positions identical with those found in other glandular kallikrein genes. The nucleotide sequence is very similar to that of the human kallikrein gene hGK-1, with 76 to 93% of the nucleotides being identical in the exons and 76 to 87% in the introns. The similarity also extends approximately 200 bp into the sequence flanking the 5' end of hGK-1 and several other, both human and rodent, glandular kallikrein genes.",1989
s54631,presentation of cmv immediate-early antigen to cytolytic t lymphocytes is selectively prevented by viral genes expressed in the early phase.,"presentation of cmv immediate-early antigen to cytolytic t lymphocytes is selectively prevented by viral genes expressed in the early phase.. The regulation of antigen processing and presentation to MHC class I-restricted cytolytic T lymphocytes was studied in cells infected with murine cytomegalovirus. Recognition by cytolytic T lymphocytes of the phosphoprotein pp89, the immunodominant viral antigen expressed in the immediate-early phase of infection, was selectively prevented during the subsequent expression of viral early genes. The surface expression of MHC class I glycoproteins and their capacity to present externally added pp89-derived antigenic peptides were not affected. Because recognition of several other antigens occurred during the early phase, a general failure in processing and presentation was excluded. Since neither rate of synthesis, amount, stability, nor nuclear transport of pp89 was modified, the failure in recognition indicates a selective interference with pp89 antigen processing and presentation.",1989
s54643,structural features of t-cell recognition: applications to vaccine design.,"structural features of t-cell recognition: applications to vaccine design.. T lymphocytes, in contrast to antibodies, appear to recognize primarily a limited number of antigenic sites on any given antigenic protein. We find that a single site can so dominate the T-cell repertoire that the presence or absence of a response to one immunodominant site can make the difference between a high responder and a low responder, even though low responders respond to other sites almost as well as high responders. Besides interaction with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, the mode by which the antigen is processed into fragments for T-cell recognition also determines which sites are seen. The products of natural processing of the protein appear to be larger than the synthetic peptides and contain structures which hinder binding to certain MHC molecules or to the T-cell receptor. A third factor in immunodominance is the intrinsic structure of the antigenic site. We have shown that amphipathic helices have a higher than random chance of being immunodominant, and have developed a computer program to locate such structures in protein amino acid sequences. We prospectively predicted sites in the malaria circumsporozoite protein and found that the four most widely recognized sites in an endemic area of West Africa were all predicted. Similarly, we identified two helper T-cell sites from the HIV (AIDS virus) envelope, and have now shown that immunization with these elicits enhanced antibody responses to the whole envelope when injected into monkeys. These sites are also recognized by human T cells from volunteers who had been immunized with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the HIV envelope. Also, because cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLS) may play a critical role in defence against AIDS, we have used a recombinant vaccinia virus and transfectants expressing the HIV envelope gene to induce specific CTLS against the HIV envelope. Using synthetic peptides, we were able to identify the first CTL recognition site in the AIDS virus. These results may contribute to the rational design of vaccines.",1989
s54656,differential pattern of t cell recognition of the 65-kda mycobacterial antigen following immunization with the whole protein or peptides.,"differential pattern of t cell recognition of the 65-kda mycobacterial antigen following immunization with the whole protein or peptides.. The 65-kDa stress protein from Mycobacterium bovis (Bacillus Calmette Guerin) elicited T cell proliferation and antibody responses in seven B10 congenic mouse strains with different H-2 haplotypes. To analyze T cell determinants on this antigen, seven peptides corresponding to six predicted T cell epitopes, and one defined B cell epitope were synthesized. Mice were either immunized with the whole antigen and the specificity of the response was ascertained in respect of the six peptides, or mice were immunized with seven of the peptides and tested for proliferative responses to the whole molecule. The results showed that three peptides carried epitopes to which mice responded following injection of the whole molecule and that immunization with two additional peptides could prime for in vitro stimulation with the native antigen. The latter result indicates the feasibility of generating T cell responses to """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""cryptic"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" epitopes on proteins by immunizing with peptides. The peptide-specific T cell responses were distinctly influenced by the H-2 haplotype of mouse strains. However, two peptides were recognized by several H-2-disparate mouse strains, and one peptide could be presented by both I-A and I-E molecules. Immunization with several peptides induced a cross-reactive T cell proliferative response to the homologous GroEL protein isolated from E. coli. The amount of cross-reactivity was influenced by the extent of sequence homology between mycobacterial and E. coli proteins and the major histocompatibility complex class II molecule used to present the peptide.",1989
s54660,a human monoclonal antibody recognizing a surface antigen on stomach cancer cells.,"a human monoclonal antibody recognizing a surface antigen on stomach cancer cells.. Lymph-node lymphocytes of a patient with stomach cancer were fused with the mouse-human heterohybridoma, HM-5. A clone (2F9) was isolated that showed stable production of an IgM antibody reactive with NUGC-4 stomach cancer cell line. This antibody reacted predominantly with a cell surface antigen on cell lines originating from gastro-intestinal cancer and adenocarcinoma of lung, whereas it was not generally reactive with other types of cancers, or with normal kidney cells or fibroblasts. Biotin-labeled 2F9 antibody clearly stained cell smears and the nude mouse tumor of NUGC-4, but it did not show a positive reaction with stomach cancer tissues obtained from more than 10 patients, indicating that the antigen detected is very weakly expressed on tumor cells or on a limited number of stomach cancers. The antigen shed from NUGC-4 cell line was detected in the culture supernatant. 2F9 antibody precipitated a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of over 200 kilodaltons as well as a possible glycolipid, from NUGC-4 cells labeled with [3H]glucosamine or [35S]-H2SO4. Periodic acid treatment of the tissue section decreased reactivity with 2F9 antibody, but heat, neuraminidase or protease treatment did not. These results suggested that the epitope is present on a carbohydrate moiety not containing sialic acid, and that a part of the antigen molecule is sulfated.",1989
s54680,a dual transcriptional activation system for the 230 kb plasmid genes coding for virulence-associated antigens of shigella flexneri.,"a dual transcriptional activation system for the 230 kb plasmid genes coding for virulence-associated antigens of shigella flexneri.. The expression of plasmid-encoded, invasion-related antigens lpa b, c and d of Shigella flexneri was found to be positively regulated at transcriptional level by a 33kD protein produced by the previously defined, virulence-associated Region 1 on the SalI fragment B of the 230 kb invasion plasmid. The gene (designated virB) was identified and its nucleotide sequence determined. No Ipa b or c was produced in the absence of an intact virB gene although lower levels of d were produced. The previously reported regulatory activity of the virF gene some 30 kb distance away was shown to act exclusively through virB. In contrast, the activation of the virG gene necessary for intercellular spread occurred directly by virF without the requirement for virB. This study thus ascribes a critical function to a previously recognized, but functionally undefined, virulence locus on the large invasion plasmid of S. flexneri. The virF gene appears to have a central role in activation of the 230 kb plasmid-encoded virulence genes.",1989
s54692,immunogenicity of peptide fusions to hepatitis b virus core antigen.,"immunogenicity of peptide fusions to hepatitis b virus core antigen.. Several gene fusions have been constructed in which coding sequences for antigenic regions of the pre-S sequences of hepatitis B virus, hepatitis B surface antigen, and the envelope protein of human immunodeficiency virus were linked to the 3' end of that for the first 144 residues of hepatitis B core antigen. The sequences were expressed efficiently in Escherichia coli to give stable products that assembled to form particles morphologically similar to hepatitis B core antigen itself. The products exhibited the antigenic and immunogenic characteristics of both the hepatitis B core antigen epitopes and the epitopes carried by the additional sequences, thus illustrating the value of such proteins as immunological reagents and potential vaccines.",1989
s54775,antigen/mhc-specific t cells are preferentially exported from the thymus in the presence of their mhc ligand.,"antigen/mhc-specific t cells are preferentially exported from the thymus in the presence of their mhc ligand.. Transgenic mice expressing a T cell receptor heterodimer specific for a fragment of pigeon cytochrome c plus an MHC class II molecule (I-Ek) have been made. We find that H-2k alpha beta transgenic mice have an overall increase in the number of T cells and express a 10-fold higher fraction of cytochrome c-reactive cells than H-2b mice. Surface staining of thymocytes indicates that in H-2b mice, T cell development is arrested at an intermediate stage of differentiation (CD4+8+, CD310). Analyses of mice carrying these T cell receptor genes and MHC class II I-E alpha constructs indicate that his developmental block can be reversed in H-2b mice by I-E expression on cortical epithelial cells of the thymus. These data suggest that a direct T cell receptor-MHC interaction occurs in the thymus in the absence of nominal antigen and results in the enhanced export of T cells, consistent with the concept of """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""positive selection"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""".",1989
s54802,murine cell-mediated immune response recognizes an enterovirus group-specific antigen(s).,"murine cell-mediated immune response recognizes an enterovirus group-specific antigen(s).. Splenocytes taken from mice inoculated with coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) (Nancy) developed an in vitro proliferative response against CVB3 antigen. This response could not be detected earlier than 8 days postinoculation but could be detected up to 28 days after exposure to CB3. CVB3-sensitized splenocytes responded not only to the CVB3 antigen but to other enteroviruses as well. This response was found to be enterovirus specific in that no response was detected to a non-enteroviral picornavirus, encephalomyocarditis virus, or to an unrelated influenza virus. The generation of a splenocyte population capable of responding to an enterovirus group antigen(s) was not limited to inoculation of mice with CVB3, as similar responses were generated when mice were inoculated with CVB2. Cell subset depletions revealed that the major cell type responding to the enterovirus group antigen(s) was the CD4+ T cell. Current evidence suggests that the group antigen(s) resides in the structural proteins of the virus, since spleen cells from mice inoculated with a UV-inactivated, highly purified preparation of CVB3 virions also responded in vitro against enteroviral antigens.",1989

To establish whether glypiation could be achieved in vitro, mRNAs generated by transcription of cDNAs encoding two GPL-anchored proteins, murine Thy-1 antigen and human decay-accelerating factor (DAF), and a conventionally anchored control protein, polymeric-immunoglobulin receptor (IgR), were translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Upon addition of dog pancreatic rough microsomes, nascent polypeptides generated from the three mRNAs translocated into vesicles. Dispersal of the vesicles with Triton X-114 detergent and incubation of the hydrophobic phase with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipases C and D, enzymes specific for GPL-anchor structures, released Thy-1 and DAF but not IgR protein into the aqueous phase. The selective incorporation of phospholipase-sensitive anchoring moieties into Thy-1 and DAF but not IgR translation products during in vitro translocation indicates that rough microsomes are able to support and regulate glypiation.",1989
s54854,"a protective monoclonal antibody recognizes an epitope in the carboxyl-terminal cysteine-rich domain in the precursor of the major merozoite surface antigen of the rodent malarial parasite, plasmodium yoelii.","a protective monoclonal antibody recognizes an epitope in the carboxyl-terminal cysteine-rich domain in the precursor of the major merozoite surface antigen of the rodent malarial parasite, plasmodium yoelii.. The 195-kDa major merozoite surface antigen of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf PMMSA) is a potential candidate for the development of a blood-stage malarial vaccine. We have focused on an analogous 230-kDa Ag of the rodent malarial parasite, Plasmodium yoelii, in an effort to study this protein in an experimental model system. Previously we reported the cloning and sequencing of a 2.1-kb portion of the gene encoding the carboxyl-terminal 77 kDa of the Py PMMSA. This region contained the B cell epitope recognized by mAb 302, a mAb shown to protect mice passively against P. yoelii challenge infection. To localize this B cell epitope, we have inserted various restriction fragments of the cloned Py PMMSA sequence into the bacterial expression vector pMG27NSTerm. Recombinant peptides of 74, 40, 34, 17, and 10 kDa have been produced which bear the epitope recognized by mAb 302. The results demonstrate that this B cell epitope is located within the most carboxyl-region of the Py PMMSA which contains a series of ten cysteine residues, also found in the PMMSA of P. falciparum. Further analysis showed that the reduction of disulfide bonds as well as the deletion of CYS-607 of the cloned sequence, resulted in the loss of the expression of this epitope. It is of interest that this epitope does not appear to be a dominant B cell determinant of the Py PMMSA molecule during infection. Inasmuch as this cysteine-rich domain of Py PMMSA displays considerable homology with that of Pf PMMSA, our data suggest that this region of the Pf PMMSA should be considered for inclusion in the development of a blood-stage vaccine.",1989

Cell adhesion molecules in the immune system are believed to play an important role in lymphocyte-target cell conjugate formation. One such molecule, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), is important in the function, aggregation, and adherence of leukocytes. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of the murine ICAM-1 gene. We report that the murine ICAM-1 gene is a member of the Ig gene superfamily, has limited homology to its human counterpart, and is expressed in cells of lymphocytic and myeloid lineages. Transfection of the ICAM-1 cDNA into MHC class II-transfected fibroblasts leads to enhancement of the Ag-specific T cell response when the transfectants are used as APC.",1989
s55079,recombinant core particles of hepatitis b virus exposing foreign antigenic determinants on their surface.,"recombinant core particles of hepatitis b virus exposing foreign antigenic determinants on their surface.. Insertion of foreign oligopeptide sequences (40-50 amino acids in length) into the Pro144 position of hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) leads to the formation of chimeric capsids in Escherichia coli cells. These capsids are morphologically and immunologically similar to native HBcAg, but expose the inserted oligopeptides on their outer surface and exhibit antigenic and immunogenic characteristics of the latter. As a source of model antigenic determinants, the appropriate DNA copies excised from cloned viral genes such as the pre-S region of hepatitis B virus, the transmembrane protein gp41 of human immunodeficiency virus 1 and the envelope protein gp51 of bovine leukemia virus have been used. The localization of the inserted antigenic determinants on the surface of chimeric capsids does not depend on the presence or absence of the arginine-rich, 39 amino acid-long C terminus of HBcAg.",1989

Salmonella species can be rationally attenuated by introducing non-reverting defined mutations into the genome to produce live vaccine strains. Several genes have been identified which when mutated, will attenuate Salmonellae. In particular, salmonella strains harbouring mutations in genes involved in the pre-chorismate biosynthetic pathway make excellent oral vaccines evoking strong humoral, local and cellular immune responses in the host. Because of the spectrum of immune responses induced by live vaccine strains they have the potential to be used for delivery of heterologous antigens to the mammalian immune system. A number of antigens from other bacteria, viruses and parasites have been expressed in live salmonella vaccine strains. Such hybrid strains have the potential to be used as multivalent vaccines against a number of infectious diseases.",1989

Fusion phage can be used as a source of antigen as a carrier-hapten conjugate for obtaining immunological reagents in rabbits, and for B epitope mapping. By generating a fusion phage library expressing virtually all possible short, amino acid sequences, it may be possible to study epitopes on immunologically important proteins without the use of synthetic peptides and without ever having cloned the genes.",1989
s55185,"cloning, expression and nucleotide sequence of the gene fragment encoding an antigenic portion of the nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase of toxoplasma gondii.","cloning, expression and nucleotide sequence of the gene fragment encoding an antigenic portion of the nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase of toxoplasma gondii.. Toxoplasma gondii expresses high levels of an active nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase (NTPase; EC 3.6.1.3) with several unique properties. It has been detected as a circulating antigen in mice, making it an ideal candidate for diagnostic tests for toxoplasmosis. A cDNA library constructed from T. gondii poly(A)+RNA was made in lambda gt11. One hundred thousand members of this library were immunoscreened with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to the purified NTPase. Six positive clones were subcloned into the plasmid, pGEX-IN, and the inserts were restriction-mapped. All clones had identical partial restriction enzyme maps. One insert was subcloned into M13mp18 and sequencing by the deoxy/dideoxy method showed an NTPase-encoding gene (ntp) fragment of 571 bp. The insert was also purified, radiolabelled, and used to hybridize to Northern blots of tachyzoite RNA and quantitative Southern blots of tachyzoite DNA. Northern blotting revealed that the NTPase mRNA was in great abundance and had a length of about 2800 nucleotides. Southern blotting showed a gene copy number of between one and five, and the possibility that ntp is tandemly repeated over a large length of DNA. The NTPase was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (EC 2.5.1.18) fusion protein of about 50 kDa, which reacted with polyclonal rabbit antibody on Western blotting.",1989
s55225,cognitive features of continuous antigenic determinants.,"cognitive features of continuous antigenic determinants.. We sought to identify the features controlling the specificity of antibody recognition and thus gain insights into molecular recognition between proteins in general. A total of 103 epitopes within 63 well-defined antigenic peptides homologous with the relevant antigen sequence were identified. The contribution of each amino acid residue to the antibody binding activity of each epitope was investigated by ELISA testing of complete sets of peptide analogs containing single amino acid replacements. The data are summarized in a replaceability matrix. Some of the high frequency replaceabilities were expected, such as aspartate for glutamate, serine for threonine, etc., but unexpected relationships were also found, such as a high degree of acceptability of methionine as a replacement. Replaceability with a residue of opposite charge was rare. Glycine and tyrosine were frequently of low acceptability, except for glycine as a replacement for alanine. It was found that on average only about four to five amino acid residues in epitopes were required to determine specificity and provide binding energy. Specificity and binding energy were attributed to amino acid side chains rather than main chain atoms. Propensity factors for occurrence of amino acids in antigenic determinants were calculated. The prominence of certain hydrophobic residues as residues critical to recognition by antibody suggests that the molecular surface of an antigen in its combined form with antibody is altered from that occurring in the absence of antibody. Thus, antigenicity is not a static surface phenomenon but depends on the ability of the antigen to undergo rearrangement, supporting the induced fit concept.",1988
s55332,homology of the 70-kilodalton antigens from mycobacterium leprae and mycobacterium bovis with the mycobacterium tuberculosis 71-kilodalton antigen and with the conserved heat shock protein 70 of eucaryotes.,"homology of the 70-kilodalton antigens from mycobacterium leprae and mycobacterium bovis with the mycobacterium tuberculosis 71-kilodalton antigen and with the conserved heat shock protein 70 of eucaryotes.. Two lambda gt11 recombinant clones, JKL2 and JKL15, each containing an insert coding for part of the highly immunogenic 70-kilodalton (kDa) protein antigen, were isolated from a Mycobacterium leprae genomic library by immunoscreening with the monoclonal antibody L7. Clone JKL2 contained the largest insert, 2.3 kilobase pairs. Nonoverlapping fragments of this insert were used as probes and showed strong hybridization to a number of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-lambda gt11 recombinants producing proteins recognized by an anti-M. tuberculosis 71-kDa monoclonal antibody, IT11. One clone from a recombinant Mycobacterium bovis library was also characterized by using L7, and the insert from this clone, B5bt, hybridized strongly to the M. leprae probes as well. The nucleotide sequence of the 1,037-base-pair coding region of the JKL2 M. leprae clone which encodes the carboxy-terminal half of the 70-kDa protein had extensive homology with genes from a number of species. In all cases, these genes, including the recently described Ag63 and Ag361 of Plasmodium falciparum, were found to be members of the heat shock protein 70 (hsp 70) family of genes. At the amino acid level, homology was maximal between amino acids 83 through 107 and 159 through 184, which showed extreme conservation (92 and 85% identity) with Escherichia coli DnaK amino acids 386 through 409 and 460 through 485, respectively, and was 51% homologous over the entire coding region (amino acids 1 through 344 of JKL2). In contrast, amino acids 129 through 158 had maximal homology with the phylogenetically more distant Xenopus laevis hsp70. Homology declined substantially in the carboxy-terminal 34 amino acids. The predicted ATP-binding functional activity of the 70-kDa antigen from M. bovis was confirmed with affinity purification of the antigen by binding to ATP-agarose and elution with ATP. In view of the conservation of sequences between these mycobacterial antigens and mammalian endogenous cellular enzymes, further evaluation of these molecules in vivo may aid in understanding tolerance to self-antigens as well as provide potentially useful immunodiagnostic reagents.",1989
s55349,"molecular cloning, genomic structure and localization in a blood stage antigen of plasmodium falciparum characterized by a serine stretch.","molecular cloning, genomic structure and localization in a blood stage antigen of plasmodium falciparum characterized by a serine stretch.. Two short DNA segments were isolated by screening of a lambda gt11 library from Plasmodium falciparum schizont cDNA with an antiserum against the 140 kDa protein, which confers protective immunity to monkeys. The segments were used to identify a genomic fragment which carries the entire coding sequence for a protein of 113 kDa characterized by a stretch of serine residues (SERP I). We present the complete nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence as well as the structure of the SERP I gene. The gene consists of four exons interrupted by three short introns located at the amino-terminal half. Exon 1 and the first part of exon 2 code for hydrophobic amino acids of a putative signal sequence. Exon 2 contains two repetitive segments, the first encoding six glycine rich octapeptides and a second region coding for 37 consecutive serine residues. Southern blot analysis demonstrated the conservation of the SERP I gene in four different parasite strains. SERP I could be localized in the parasitophorous vacuole and in the surrounding membranes. We discuss the relationship of this protein to the recently described P126 polypeptide and the possible role of this antigen as a vaccine candidate.",1989
s55354,recombinant system for overexpression of cholera toxin b subunit in vibrio cholerae as a basis for vaccine development.,"recombinant system for overexpression of cholera toxin b subunit in vibrio cholerae as a basis for vaccine development.. We have constructed an overexpression system in which the gene encoding the B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB) was placed under the control of the strong tacP promoter in a wide host range plasmid. Recombinant nontoxigenic classical and E1 Tor Vibrio cholerae strains of different serotypes harboring this plasmid excreted 10- to 100-fold higher amounts of CTB than any other wild-type or recombinant strain tested and may therefore be useful killed oral vaccine strains. The manipulations to place the CTB gene under tacP also included, by design, the introduction of single enzyme restriction sites for gene fusions to the CTB amino terminus. Cloning into these sites allows construction of CTB-derived hybrid proteins carrying various putative vaccine peptide antigens.",1989
s55736,transcriptional regulation of the protective antigen gene of bacillus anthracis.,"transcriptional regulation of the protective antigen gene of bacillus anthracis.. Bicarbonate is required for production of the major virulence factors, the toxins and capsule, of Bacillus anthracis. In this study we examined the basis for stimulation of production of protective antigen (PA), a central component of the two anthrax toxins encoded by plasmid pXO1. RNA prepared from B. anthracis grown in media with and without added bicarbonate was probed for PA mRNA. Data showed that bicarbonate was required for increased transcription of the PA gene (pag) in minimal medium. Transcription of pag was low in rich medium and could not be stimulated by the addition of bicarbonate. To characterize further the factors required for transcriptional regulation of pag, the promoter region of pag was fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (cat-86) of vector pPL703 and transformed by electroporation into pXO1+ (Tox+) and pXO1- (Tox-) strains of B. anthracis. Analysis of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase produced by the pag-cat-86 fusion in each of these backgrounds confirmed the results obtained by hybridization. Data obtained with this fusion also revealed that the large toxin plasmid, pXO1, found in virulent strains of B. anthracis, was required for stimulation of transcription of pag by bicarbonate. This result suggests the existence of a trans-acting factor that is involved in the activation of pag transcription.",1989
s56042,a deleted variant of bacillus anthracis protective antigen is non-toxic and blocks anthrax toxin action in vivo.,"a deleted variant of bacillus anthracis protective antigen is non-toxic and blocks anthrax toxin action in vivo.. Anthrax toxin is the only protein secreted by Bacillus anthracis that contributes to the virulence of this bacterium. An obligatory step in the action of anthrax toxin on eukaryotic cells is cleavage of the receptor-bound protective antigen (PA) protein (83 kilodaltons) to produce a 63-kilodalton, receptor-bound COOH-terminal fragment. A similar fragment can be obtained by limited treatment with trypsin. This proteolytic processing event exposes a site with high affinity for the other two anthrax toxin proteins, lethal factor and edema factor. Terminal sequencing of the purified fragment showed that the activating cleavage occurred in the sequence Arg164-Lys165-Lys166-Arg167. The gene encoding PA was mutagenized to delete residues 163-168, and the deleted PA was purified from a Bacillus subtilis host. The deleted PA was not cleaved by either trypsin or the cell-surface protease, and was non-toxic when administered with lethal factor. Purified, deleted PA protected rats when administered 90 min before injection of 20 minimum lethal doses of toxin. This mutant PA may be useful as a replacement for the PA that is the major active ingredient in the current human anthrax vaccine, because deleted PA is expected to have normal immunogenicity, but would not combine with trace amounts of LF and EF to cause toxicity.",1989
s56393,"efficacy of oil-emulsion vaccines prepared with pigeon paramyxovirus-1, ulster, and la sota newcastle disease viruses.","efficacy of oil-emulsion vaccines prepared with pigeon paramyxovirus-1, ulster, and la sota newcastle disease viruses.. Three strains of avian paramyxovirus-1 virus (PMV-1) were used to prepare four experimental monovalent oil-emulsion vaccines. A pigeon PMV-1 isolate (PPMV-1) and the Newcastle disease virus strains La Sota and Ulster were used to prepare four pools of beta-propiolactone-inactivated allantoic fluid for the vaccines. Groups of susceptible white rock chickens and racing homing pigeons were vaccinated subcutaneously with one of the vaccines, and their serologic responses were determined using the hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test at frequent intervals up to 9 weeks postvaccination. Pigeons were challenged after 10 weeks with a virulent PPMV-1 isolate given intravenously, observed for signs of disease for 5 weeks, and then tested for secondary serologic HI responses. The HI responses were measured using the three strains of virus as HI test antigens. The titers were generally greater when the hemagglutination antigen used in the test was homologous with the antigen used to prepare the vaccine. All vaccines protected pigeons against morbidity and death but not against infection with the challenge virus. The shedding of PPMV-1 challenge virus from PPMV-1 vaccinates was greatly reduced 6 days after challenge.",1989
s56458,t cell tolerance to mlsa encoded antigens in t cell receptor v beta 8.1 chain transgenic mice.,"t cell tolerance to mlsa encoded antigens in t cell receptor v beta 8.1 chain transgenic mice.. To study T cell tolerance, transgenic mice were generated that expressed the Mlsa-reactive T cell receptor (TCR) beta chain V beta 8.1 (cDNA) under the control of the H-2Kb promoter/immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer on approximately 90% of peripheral T cells. In transgenic mice bearing Mlsa, thymocytes expressing the TCR at a high density were deleted and the percentage of Thy 1.2+ lymph node cells was reduced. The CD4/CD8 ratio of mature T cells was reversed in Mlsa and Mlsb transgenic mice independent of the H-2. RNA analysis and immunofluorescence with TCR V beta-specific antibodies revealed that expression of endogenous TCR beta genes was suppressed. Both Mlsa and Mlsb TCR beta chain transgenic mice mounted a T-cell-dependent IgG response against viral antigens, whereas the capacity to generate alloreactive and virus-specific cytotoxic T cells was impaired in TCR beta chain transgenic Mlsa, but not in transgenic Mlsb mice.",1989
s56494,"the 1b (ns2), 1c (ns1) and n proteins of human respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) of antigenic subgroups a and b: sequence conservation and divergence within rsv genomic rna.","the 1b (ns2), 1c (ns1) and n proteins of human respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) of antigenic subgroups a and b: sequence conservation and divergence within rsv genomic rna.. A 2330 nucleotide sequence spanning the 1B (NS2), IC (NS1) and N genes and intergenic regions of human respiratory syncytial virus strain 18537, representing antigenic subgroup B, was determined by sequencing cloned cDNAs of intracellular mRNAs. Comparison with the previously reported sequences for strain A2 of subgroup A showed that 1B, 1C and N were highly conserved at the nucleotide level (78, 78 and 86% identity, respectively) and at the amino acid level (92, 87 and 96% identity, respectively). The gene-start signals were exactly conserved between subgroups, and the gene-end signals contained only a single nucleotide substitution each in 1B and N. In most cases intergenic and non-coding gene sequences that were not part of presumed transcriptive signals were much less well conserved (generally 50 to 71%) than sequences that were part of translational open reading frames (82 to 86%). The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the N gene and protein of the Long strain of subgroup A were determined by sequencing cDNA clones of intracellular mRNA; the nucleotide sequence (representing all but the first 10 nucleotides of the gene) contained 15 differences from that of the A2 strain, but the deduced amino acid sequences were identical.",1989
s56532,immunologic tolerance: collaboration between antigen and lymphokines.,"immunologic tolerance: collaboration between antigen and lymphokines.. Immunologic tolerance is the process whereby limits are placed on the degree to which lymphocytes respond to an animal's inherent antigens. It is a quantitative rather than an absolute term, as some autoantibody formation is common. Contrary to early hopes, it is not due to some single, simple causative mechanism confined to early developmental stages of the fetal immune system. Rather, self-tolerance results from a variety of complementary mechanisms and feedback loops in the immune system and is thus best seen as part of the general process of immunoregulation.",1989
s56566,serum- and oncoprotein-mediated induction of a gene with sequence similarity to the gene encoding carcinoembryonic antigen.,"serum- and oncoprotein-mediated induction of a gene with sequence similarity to the gene encoding carcinoembryonic antigen.. We describe the molecular identification of a gene, designated T1, whose expression in mouse NIH 3T3 cells is strongly induced by the Ha-ras(EJ) and v-mos oncogenes and by serum. The T1 gene encodes a 38.5-kDa protein, as predicted from its primary sequence and shown by in vitro translation. The protein was processed at its amino terminus and extensively modified by N-linked glycosylation in vitro in the presence of microsomal vesicles. Sequence comparison of T1 with the MIPSX data base (Max-Planck-Institut fur Biochemie, Martinsried/Munich) revealed similarity to the human carcinoembryonic antigen, a tumor marker which is overexpressed in colon adenocarcinomas and in fetal tissues. Considerable sequence similarity has also been observed to the short conserved region of other proteins which, like carcinoembryonic antigen, are encoded by members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily.",1989
s56593,the importance of the crystalline surface layer protein antigens of rickettsiae in t-cell immunity.,"the importance of the crystalline surface layer protein antigens of rickettsiae in t-cell immunity.. Studies in animal models have demonstrated that solid immunity to typhus rickettsiae is dependent on immune T cells. In addition, the surface protein antigen (SPA) of typhus rickettsiae has been shown to be an effective immunogen, protecting vaccinated animals against subsequent challenge with virulent organisms. In the present studies we describe three classes of human lymphocytes which are capable of lysing cells infected with typhus rickettsiae. The first class is CD3,8-positive and is capable of specially lysing both HLA-matched and mismatched targets infected with typhus rickettsiae. Since this cytotoxic effector can be generated with IL-2 as well as with SPA it appears to be a lymphokine-activated killer (LAK). The second class of lymphocytes is CD3,4-positive and is capable of producing gamma interferon in response to the SPA of typhus rickettsiae. Gamma interferon in turn can cause the lysis of cells infected with typhus rickettsiae as well as inhibit intracellular rickettsial growth. A third cytotoxic effector which is CD3,4-positive and which is capable of lysing only HLA-matched targets infected with typhus rickettsiae was generated with a sonicated antigen, and its fine antigenic specificity is not known at present. We conclude that the SPA is an immunologically important protein for the human host and represents an outstanding candidate for a subunit vaccine against typhus.",1989
s56629,the pres1 antigen of hepatitis b virus is highly immunogenic at the t cell level in man.,"the pres1 antigen of hepatitis b virus is highly immunogenic at the t cell level in man.. 14 hepatitis B vaccine recipients who showed high titers of anti-hepatitis B surface antibodies in serum after booster immunization with a polyvalent hepatitis B surface antigen vaccine that contained trace amounts of hepatitis B virus (HBV) preS1 and preS2 envelope antigens were studied for their in vitro T cell response to these antigens. All 14 subjects displayed a significant proliferative T cell response to the S/p25 envelope region encoded polypeptide; 8 also responded to preS1, while only 1 showed a significant level of T cell proliferation to preS2. Limiting dilution analysis demonstrated that the frequency of preS-specific T cells in two of these vaccine recipients was higher than that of S/p25-specific T cells. T cell cloning was then performed and a total of 29 HBV envelope antigen-reactive CD4+ cloned lines were generated from two preS-responsive vaccines. 21 of these lines were S/p25 specific, 7 preS1 specific, and 1 preS2 specific. Taken together, all these results suggest that the preS1 antigen may function as a strong T cell immunogen in man.",1989
s57135,the rhesus rotavirus outer capsid protein vp4 functions as a hemagglutinin and is antigenically conserved when expressed by a baculovirus recombinant.,"the rhesus rotavirus outer capsid protein vp4 functions as a hemagglutinin and is antigenically conserved when expressed by a baculovirus recombinant.. Rhesus rotavirus (RRV) gene 4 was cloned into lambda bacteriophage, inserted into a polyhedrin promoter shuttle plasmid, and expressed in Sf9 cells by a recombinant baculovirus. The baculovirus-expressed VP4 protein made up approximately 5% of the Spodoptera frugiperda-infected cell protein. Monoclonal antibodies that neutralize the virus bound to the expressed VP4 polypeptide, indicating that the expressed VP4 protein was antigenically indistinguishable from viral VP4. In addition, we have determined that the baculovirus-expressed VP4 protein bound to erythrocytes and functions as the RRV hemagglutinin. The endogenous hemagglutinating activity of the VP4 protein, like the virus, was inhibited by guinea pig antirotavirus hyperimmune serum and by VP4-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. The human erythrocyte protein, glycophorin, also inhibited hemagglutination by RRV or the expressed VP4 protein and appears to be the rotavirus erythrocyte receptor. The baculovirus-expressed VP4 protein was conserved functionally and antigenically in the absence of other outer or inner capsid rotavirus components and represents a logical candidate for future immunological studies.",1989

The VP7 gene was cloned, and its nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences were compared to other published VP7 gene sequences. Consistent with the serological evidence, two major antigenic regions of the B37 VP7 (i.e., regions A and B) differ in sequence from those of other G serotypes. Unexpectedly, the C antigenic region shows close similarity to G3 rotaviruses, but we were unable to detect a serological relationship using serotype 3 monoclonal antibodies.",1989
s57458,cell lines established by a temperature-sensitive simian virus 40 large-t-antigen gene are growth restricted at the nonpermissive temperature.,"cell lines established by a temperature-sensitive simian virus 40 large-t-antigen gene are growth restricted at the nonpermissive temperature.. The thermolabile large T antigen, encoded by the simian virus 40 early-region mutant tsA58, was used to establish clonal cell lines derived from rat embryo fibroblasts. These cell lines grew continuously at the permissive temperature but upon shift-up to the nonpermissive temperature showed rapidly arrested growth. The growth arrest occurred in either the G1 or G2 phase of the cell cycle. After growth arrest, the cells remained metabolically active as assayed by general protein synthesis and the ability to exclude trypan blue. The inability of these cell lines to divide at the nonpermissive temperature was not readily complemented by the exogenous introduction of other nuclear oncogenes. This finding suggests that either these genes establish cells via different pathways or that immortalization by one oncogene results in a finely balanced cellular state which cannot be adequately complemented by another establishment gene.",1989
s57529,use of human adenovirus-based vectors for antigen expression in animals.,"use of human adenovirus-based vectors for antigen expression in animals.. An infectious recombinant human adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) vector, AdG12, which carries the glycoprotein gene of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and expresses that gene in cultured HeLa cells was used to examine the host range of insert expression by human Ad vectors. The VSV glycoprotein was expressed in bovine, canine and murine cells when infected with AdG12 in culture. These cell lines are respectively permissive, non-permissive and semi-permissive for human Ad5 replication. Administration of the AdG12 vector to calves, piglets or dogs by either the subcutaneous or oral route resulted in the production of high titres of neutralizing antibodies to VSV. Mice injected intraperitoneally with the vector produced neutralizing antibodies and were protected against subsequent intravenous challenge with normally lethal doses of VSV. This work demonstrates the utility of human adenoviral vectors for antigen expression in a number of non-human cell lines and for the induction of an immune response to the delivered antigen in a number of species.",1989
s57654,"structure and mapping of antigenic domains of protein antigen b, a 38,000-molecular-weight protein of mycobacterium tuberculosis.","structure and mapping of antigenic domains of protein antigen b, a 38,000-molecular-weight protein of mycobacterium tuberculosis.. Only a limited number of proteins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis have so far been shown to possess species-specific epitopes as defined by monoclonal antibodies. One such protein is protein antigen b (Pab) of molecular weight 38,000, which binds the monoclonal antibodies HYT 28, HAT 2, HBT 12, HGT 3, TB 71, and TB 72. The gene encoding this protein was isolated from a lambda gt11 M. tuberculosis DNA library. The nucleotide sequence of the recombinant mycobacterial insert was determined, and an open reading frame of 374 amino acids was identified. The amino acid sequence exhibited 30% homology to a phosphate-binding protein, PstS, from Escherichia coli. The pab gene was subcloned into pBR322 in conjunction with the lacZ gene, and deletions were obtained from the 3' end. The anti-Pab monoclonal antibodies were used to probe crude protein lysates of E. coli transformed with the deletion plasmids. The monoclonal antibodies showed two reactivity patterns; one group of antibodies were dependent on the presence of the ultimate 91 amino acids of the protein, whereas another group of antibodies recognized an antigenic domain located on the middle portion of the molecule. None of the antibodies bound to the N-terminal 117-amino-acid peptide.",1989
s58095,antigenic properties and cellular localization of herpes simplex virus glycoprotein h synthesized in a mammalian cell expression system.,"antigenic properties and cellular localization of herpes simplex virus glycoprotein h synthesized in a mammalian cell expression system.. Herpes simplex virus type 1 glycoprotein H (HSV-1 gH) was synthesized in an inducible mammalian cell expression system, and its properties were examined. The gH coding sequence, together with the stable 5' untranslated leader sequence from xenopus beta-globin, was placed under control of the strong promoter from the human cytomegalovirus major immediate-early gene in an amplifiable plasmid which contains the simian virus 40 (SV40) virus origin for replication (ori). This expression vector was transfected into ts COS cells constitutively expressing a temperature-sensitive SV40 T antigen which allows utilization of the SV40 ori at permissive temperatures. The results of transient expression assays at the permissive temperature showed that HSV-1 gH could be synthesized in greater amounts than those produced by a high-multiplicity virus infection. The proteins produced were detected in Western blots (immunoblots) with a HSV-1 gH-specific polyclonal serum raised against a TrpE-gH fusion protein. The transfected gH had an apparent molecular weight of approximately 105,000, intermediate in size to those of the precursor (100,000) and fully processed forms (110,000) of HSV-1 gH from infections. Antigenicity was investigated by reactions with three virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies specific for conformational epitopes on gH. Only one of these monoclonal antibodies could immunoprecipitate the synthesized gH. However, equal recognition of the transfected gH was achieved by superinfection with virus. In addition, detectable amounts of gH were not expressed on the cell surface unless the cells were superinfected with virus. Studies with a temperature-sensitive mutant, ts1201, defective in encapsidation showed that the changes in antigenic structure and cell surface expression caused by superinfection with virus were not due simply to incorporation of gH into virions. These results suggest that gH requires additional virus gene products for cell surface localization and formation of an antigenic structure important for its function in mediating infectivity.",1989
s58400,a versatile and potentially general approach to the targeting of specific cell types by retroviruses: application to the infection of human cells by means of major histocompatibility complex class i and class ii antigens by mouse ecotropic murine leukemia virus-derived viruses.,"a versatile and potentially general approach to the targeting of specific cell types by retroviruses: application to the infection of human cells by means of major histocompatibility complex class i and class ii antigens by mouse ecotropic murine leukemia virus-derived viruses.. A technique for delivering genes carried by recombinant retroviruses into specific cell types could have numerous applications in oncology, developmental biology, and gene therapy. As a first step toward this remote goal we designed a procedure allowing in vitro cell targeting by retroviruses. Biotinylated antibodies against the viral envelope protein on one side, and against specific cell membrane markers on the other side, were bridged by streptavidin and used to link the virus to the host. The method was successfully used to infect human cells with ecotropic murine retroviruses by means of major histocompatibility complex class I and class II antigens and appears easily adaptable to other cell membrane markers. Moreover, the sequential protocol we designed, although allowing infection of human cells, requires less stringent safety constraints than would handling of amphotropic virus stocks.",1989
s58714,molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the colonization factor antigen i gene of escherichia coli.,"molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the colonization factor antigen i gene of escherichia coli.. The colonization factor antigen I (CFA/I) gene has been isolated and sequenced. The amino acid sequence of CFA/I deduced from the nucleotide sequence is composed of 170 amino acids. The first 23 amino acids are considered to be the signal peptide of the CFA/I protein since they are not present in the protein sequence. Among the remaining amino acids, only two are different from the protein sequence: amino acid position 76 is an aspartic acid instead of an asparagine, and position 97 is a serine instead of an alanine. The CFA/I gene has a typical Shine-Dalgarno sequence located 10 base pairs (bp) upstream from the initiation codon. The sequence TACAAT located 48 bp upstream from the initiation codon was tentatively designated the -10 sequence of the CFA/I gene promoter. No sequences homologous to the consensus -35 promoter sequence was found. A pair of inverted repeat sequences followed by a stretch of eight A's are located 45 bp downstream from the termination codon of the CFA/I gene; this region may be a rho-independent transcriptional terminator.",1989

The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA, cyclin) was originally defined as a nuclear protein whose appearance correlated with the proliferative state of the cell. It is now known to be a co-factor of DNA polymerase delta and to be necessary for DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression. cDNA clones of human PCNA have been isolated and, using one of these cDNA, we have now obtained from a lambda phage library a clone containing the entire human PCNA gene and flanking sequences. The human PCNA gene is a unique copy gene and has 6 exons. It spans, from the cap site to the poly(A) signal 4961 base pairs. We have identified, in the 5'-flanking sequence, a region with promoter activity, a well as other structural elements common to other promoters. An interesting feature of the PCNA gene is the presence of extensive sequence similarities among introns and between introns and exons.",1989
s58765,"the human platelet alloantigens, pla1 and pla2, are associated with a leucine33/proline33 amino acid polymorphism in membrane glycoprotein iiia, and are distinguishable by dna typing.","the human platelet alloantigens, pla1 and pla2, are associated with a leucine33/proline33 amino acid polymorphism in membrane glycoprotein iiia, and are distinguishable by dna typing.. The human platelet alloantigens, PlA1 and PlA2, comprise a diallelic antigen system located on a component of the platelet fibrinogen receptor, membrane glycoprotein (GP) IIIa. Of the known platelet alloantigens, PlA1, which is carried by 98% of the caucasian population, appears to be the alloantigen that most often provokes neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenic purpura and posttransfusion purpura. The structural features of the GPIIIa molecule responsible for its antigenicity are as yet unknown. Using the polymerase chain reaction (PcR), we amplified the NH2-terminal region of platelet GPIIIa mRNA derived from PlA1 and PlA2 homozygous individuals. Nucleotide sequence analysis of selected amplified cDNA products revealed a C in equilibrium T polymorphism at base 196 that created a unique Nci I restriction enzyme cleavage site in the PlA2, but not the PlA1 form of GPIIIa cDNA. Subsequent restriction enzyme analysis of cDNAs generated by PcR from 10 PlA1/A1, 5 PlA2/A2, and 3 PlA1/A2 individuals showed that Nci I digestion permitted clear discrimination between the PlA1 and PlA2 alleles of GPIIIa. All PlA2/A2 individuals studied contain a C at base 196, whereas PlA1 homozygotes have a T at this position. This single base change results in a leucine/proline polymorphism at amino acid 33 from the NH2-terminus, and is likely to impart significant differences in the secondary structures of these two allelic forms of the GPIIIa molecule. The ability to perform DNA-typing analysis for PlA phenotype may have a number of useful clinical applications, including fetal testing and determination of the phenotype of severely thrombocytopenic individuals.",1989
s58952,immunogenicity and efficacy testing in chimpanzees of an oral hepatitis b vaccine based on live recombinant adenovirus.,"immunogenicity and efficacy testing in chimpanzees of an oral hepatitis b vaccine based on live recombinant adenovirus.. As a major cause of acute and chronic liver disease as well as hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatitis B virus (HBV) continues to pose significant health problems world-wide. Recombinant hepatitis B vaccines based on adenovirus vectors have been developed to address global needs for effective control of hepatitis B infection. Although considerable progress has been made in the construction of recombinant adenoviruses that express large amounts of HBV gene products, preclinical immunogenicity and efficacy testing of candidate vaccines has remained difficult due to the lack of a suitable animal model. We demonstrate here that chimpanzees are susceptible to enteric infection by human adenoviruses type 7 (Ad7) and type 4 (Ad4) following oral administration of live virus. Moreover, after sequential oral immunization with Ad7- and Ad4-vectored vaccines containing the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) gene, significant antibody responses to HBsAg (anti-HBs) were induced in two chimpanzees. After challenge with heterologous HBV, one chimpanzee was protected from acute hepatitis and the other chimpanzee experienced modified HBV-induced disease. These data demonstrate the feasibility of using orally administered recombinant adenoviruses as a general approach to vaccination.",1989
s59345,dissection of mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens using recombinant dna.,"dissection of mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens using recombinant dna.. A recombinant DNA strategy has been used systematically to survey the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome for sequences that encode specific antigens detected by monoclonal antibodies. M. tuberculosis genomic DNA fragments with randomly generated endpoints were used to construct a large lambda gt11 recombinant DNA expression library. Sufficient numbers of recombinants were produced to contain inserts whose endpoints occur at nearly every base pair in the pathogen genome. Protein antigens specified by linear segments of pathogen DNA and produced by the recombinant phage of Escherichia coli were screened with monoclonal antibody probes. This approach was coupled with an improved detection method for gene isolation using antibodies to clonally isolate DNA sequences that specify polypeptide components of M. tuberculosis. The methodology described here, which is applicable to other pathogens, offers possibilities for the development of more sensitive and specific immunodiagnostic and seroepidemiological tests for tuberculosis and, ultimately, for the development of more effective vaccines.",1985
s59402,the gene for an exported antigen of the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum cloned and expressed in escherichia coli.,"the gene for an exported antigen of the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum cloned and expressed in escherichia coli.. An exported protein of the erythrocytic stages of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, has epitope(s) in common with the surface of the sporozoite stage (1). Two cDNA clones encoding this protein, Ag5.1, have now been isolated and expressed in Escherichia coli. The coding sequence contains a region with strong homology to that of the circumsporozoite protein of P. falciparum. Other features of the sequence can be explained in terms of the observed behaviour of the protein in the parasite life cycle. The Ag5.1 can now be synthesised in bacteria in sufficient amounts to analyse the immune response to this protein.",1985
s59496,induction of antitumor immunity in mice by allo-major histocompatibility complex class i gene transfectant with strong antigen expression.,"induction of antitumor immunity in mice by allo-major histocompatibility complex class i gene transfectant with strong antigen expression.. An allo-major histocompatibility complex class I gene (H-2Kb) was transfected to murine mastocytoma P1.HTR (P815 subline) cells, after which several transfectant clones were obtained. Two clones, which expressed a low level of H-2Kb antigen, grew well and killed the syngeneic DBA/2 mice when they were inoculated ip. These mice lived longer than the mice given injections of the parental P1.HTR tumor. However, one clone, which expressed a high level of H-2Kb antigen, was rejected completely by the syngeneic DBA/2 mice and induced a generation of H-2Kb-specific cytotoxic T cells. Interestingly, the mice that had rejected the clone with high H-2Kb expression received strong anti-tumor immunity for rejection of the parental P1.HTR tumor challenged at the high dose.",1989
s59613,mechanism of antigen-driven selection in germinal centres.,"mechanism of antigen-driven selection in germinal centres.. The high affinity of antibodies produced during responses to T-cell-dependent antigens is associated with somatic mutation in the variable region of the immunoglobulin. Indirect evidence indicates that: (1) this arises by a process of hypermutation, acting selectively on rearranged immunoglobulin variable-region genes, which is activated in centroblasts within germinal centres; and (2) centrocytes, the progeny of centroblasts, undergo selection on the basis of their ability to receive a positive signal from antigen. We have now performed experiments analysing this selection process, and found that, on culture, centrocytes isolated from human tonsil kill themselves within a few hours by apoptosis. This is not a feature of other tonsillar B cells. Centrocytes can be prevented from entering apoptosis if they are activated both through their receptors for antigen and a surface glycoprotein recognized by CD40 antibodies.",1989
s59968,in vitro differentiation and antigenic changes in human melanoma cell lines.,"in vitro differentiation and antigenic changes in human melanoma cell lines.. Malignant transformation of melanocytes may be associated with changes in the expression of HLA antigens and melanoma-associated antigens (MAA). To determine whether these changes reflect the differential expression of HLA antigens and MAA by melanocytes at different stages of differentiation, we have studied the effect of the reversible induction of differentiation by fibroblast interferon (interferon beta) and/or 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) on the expression of HLA antigens and MAA by the melanoma cell lines DU-2, FO-1 and HO-1. The three melanoma cell lines differed in their sensitivity to the differentiating and antiproliferative activity of these two compounds and displayed an increased growth suppression and induction of differentiation, when incubated with the combination of TPA and interferon beta. Incubation of the three melanoma cell lines with interferon beta, TPA or their combination resulted in a differential modulation of the expression of membrane-bound high-molecular-mass melanoma-associated antigen, 115-kDa MAA, 100-kDa MAA, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, HLA class I antigens and gene products of the HLA-D region. Each melanoma cell line displayed a unique pattern of antigenic modulation when exposed to the two differentiating agents alone or in combination. No direct relationship was found between the effects of interferon beta and/or TPA on the growth and differentiation of the three melanoma cell lines and the expression of HLA antigens or the MAA evaluated in the present study. These findings argue against a direct role of any of the antigens tested in the reversible induction of human melanoma cell differentiation in the in vitro system.",1989
s60103,restricted or absent immune responses in human populations to plasmodium falciparum gamete antigens that are targets of malaria transmission-blocking antibodies.,"restricted or absent immune responses in human populations to plasmodium falciparum gamete antigens that are targets of malaria transmission-blocking antibodies.. We have studied the antibodies to sexual stage antigens of Plasmodium falciparum in human sera from Papua New Guinea where intense transmission of P. falciparum occurs as well as the less prevalent P. malariae and P. vivax. In extracts of gametes of P. falciparum we have studied the reactivity of serum antibodies with antigens labeled with 125I on the surface of the gametes as well as intracellular gamete antigens. A prominent 27-kD sexual stage-specific intracellular protein was recognized more or less in proportion to the general antibody response to gamete proteins. The response to the gamete surface proteins, however, was quite unrepresentative of the general antibody response to the intracellular gamete proteins. No antibodies were detected against Pfs25, a 21-kD protein expressed on zygotes and ookinetes of P. falciparum and known to be a sensitive target of malaria transmission-blocking antibodies. The antibody response to two other target antigens of transmission-blocking antibodies on the surface of gametes of P. falciparum, a 230- and a 48- and 45-kD protein doublet, was very variable and independent of the response to the internal protein antigens. Several possibilities are discussed that may account for the variable response to these gamete surface antigens in individuals with otherwise good antibody responses to internal sexual stage proteins. Among these is the possibility that there is MHC restriction of the immune response to the gamete surface antigens in the human population. This interpretation accords well with evidence for MHC-restricted immune response to the same P. falciparum gamete surface antigens in studies with H-2 congenic mice (24).",1989
s60330,immunoassay for serologic diagnosis of influenza type a using recombinant dna produced nucleoprotein antigen and monoclonal antibody to human igg.,"immunoassay for serologic diagnosis of influenza type a using recombinant dna produced nucleoprotein antigen and monoclonal antibody to human igg.. Influenza type A nucleoprotein (NP) derived from the full length cloned gene expressed in E. coli was evaluated in a solid phase enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for detection of human antibody to influenza. Monoclonal antibody to human IgG was used for detection. Direct and indirect assays were developed and sera were tested in serial and single dilution formats. Preliminary results indicated that recombinant-and virion-derived NP antigens were comparable in binding ability to plastic and binding human antibody. Eighty-seven paired sera from influenza patients were tested. The most sensitive assay (indirect-serial dilution) detected 56 (64%) rises and the simplest assay (direct-single dilution) detected 43 (49%) rises, compared to 36 (41%) for complement fixation. Paired sera from 18 control patients showed no evidence of antibody rises by any of the assays. Forty-nine paired sera from influenza B infected patients were negative for antibody rises except for one borderline rise by the indirect-serial dilution assay. These results indicate that the use of recombinant DNA derived nucleoprotein for immunoassay is feasible. The sensitivity of immunoassays using NP adsorbed to the solid phase and monoclonal antibody specific for human IgG to detect bound antibody exceeded that of conventional complement fixation testing for establishing serologic evidence of influenza type A infection.",1989
s60342,complementation of recombinant baculoviruses by coinfection with wild-type virus facilitates production in insect larvae of antigenic proteins of hepatitis b virus and influenza virus.,"complementation of recombinant baculoviruses by coinfection with wild-type virus facilitates production in insect larvae of antigenic proteins of hepatitis b virus and influenza virus.. We describe the coinfection of insects with wild-type and recombinant baculoviruses in which the polyhedrin gene promoter is used to express hepatitis B virus envelope protein (hepatitis B virus surface antigen; HBsAg) or influenza A virus neuraminidase (NA). Viruses were administered per os to larvae of the cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni, causing an infection that within 5 days resulted in the production of approximately 0.15 mg of HBsAg per insect, representing 1.5% of the total extracted protein, or approximately 2.8 mg of NA per insect, representing 28% of the total extractable protein. The HBsAg and NA produced by infected larvae were purified from insect lysates. These proteins were antigenic as determined by conformation-dependent immunoassays. The NA was enzymatically active with conventional substrates. The method of infection described allows genetic complementation by wild-type virus of recombinant viruses lacking the polyhedrin gene essential for infection per os and has implications for the high-yield production in insect larvae of other recombinant proteins of baculoviruses.",1989
s60406,expression and characterization of hepatitis b virus surface antigen polypeptides in insect cells with a baculovirus expression system.,"expression and characterization of hepatitis b virus surface antigen polypeptides in insect cells with a baculovirus expression system.. The baculovirus Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus was used as an expression vector to produce hepatitis B virus surface antigen with and without the pre-S domain. The S gene product was expressed as both fusion and nonfusion polypeptides. No difference was observed in the posttranslational modification of the fusion and nonfusion polypeptides. The S proteins were not secreted into the medium but were inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum, glycosylated, and partially extruded into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum as 22-nm lipoprotein particles. The oligosaccharide chains on the insect cell-derived S protein were of the N-linked high-mannose form, in contrast to the complex-type oligosaccharides detected on plasma-derived hepatitis B virus surface antigen. The pre-S-S polypeptides were inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum, glycosylated, and modified by fatty acid acylation with myristic acid. A procedure was developed to purify the S protein from cellular membranes by using detergent extraction and immunoaffinity chromatography. The purified S protein was in the form of protein-detergent micelles and was highly antigenic and immunogenic.",1989
s60584,evaluation of the protective potency of new tuberculosis vaccines.,"evaluation of the protective potency of new tuberculosis vaccines.. Animal models used to evaluate the relative protective potency of a panel of tuberculosis vaccines have yielded dissimilar data. Moreover, it is not known which animal model predicts the protective potency of vaccines for humans. Accordingly, animal models should be developed on the basis of an understanding of the key events in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis in humans. Vaccines such as bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) appear to protect against tuberculosis by inhibiting the bacillemic phase of primary infection with virulent tubercle bacilli; therefore, such vaccines can be expected to provide protection against tuberculosis developing via the endogenous reactivation pathway but not against disease developing via the exogenous reinfection pathway. To protect against disease developing by the latter pathway, it would appear that new vaccines produced by recombinant DNA technology or through use of monoclonal antibody would have to inhibit the implantation of bacilli at the portal of entry in the lungs. Experience with BCG vaccine indicates that factors other than the inherent potency of the vaccine play a decisive role in the outcome of vaccine trials in humans. These same factors will probably influence field trials of any new generation of tuberculosis vaccines.",1989
s60817,selective delivery of antigens by recombinant bacteria.,"selective delivery of antigens by recombinant bacteria.. The means to attenuate Salmonella and to endow such avirulent strains with the ability to express colonization and virulence antigens from other pathogens has achieved considerable progress during the past several years. One can therefore begin to design and construct strains with specificity to a given animal host and to express in a defined way specific colonization and virulence antigens in a manner to stimulate long-lasting immunity to the Salmonella and to the pathogen supplying the genetic information for the colonization and virulence antigens. Since most pathogens colonize on or invade through mucosal surfaces, the use of recombinant bivalent Salmonella vaccine strains to stimulate a mucosal immune response would induce the development of a first line of defense against a diversity of pathogens. Mucosal immunity should therefore reduce contagious spread of many pathogens since the dose to overcome the mucosal immune barrier would be increased to result in a diminished likelihood of infection. The fact that the recombinant Salmonella vaccine strains also induce humoral and cellular immune responses justifies their use for induction of long-lasting immunity. Although considerable progress has been made in targeting antigens to the GALT by use of avirulent Salmonella, a similar strategy for delivery of antigens to the BALT has yet to be discovered and developed. In addition to constituting a system for induction of immunity against a diversity of pathogens, the recombinant avirulent Salmonella system should provide a means to explore parameters of the mucosal immune response. This would include investigation of the location and duration of memory, the age dependence of induction of mucosal immunity, and the means for the possible induction of oral tolerance with regard to either the mucosal or humoral response to an antigen expressed by the recombinant Salmonella. It is also possible to contemplate using the avirulent Salmonella to target expression of various modulators of the immune system such as interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma to the GALT and thus further enhance the immune response. Lastly, one can introduce into avirulent Salmonella strains genes for putative colonization antigens in order to investigate whether induction of an immune response against the putative colonization antigen does or does not interfere with infection. This system, therefore, permits another means to analyze the relative importance of various bacterial surface attributes in conferring pathogenicity to the microbe.",1989
s60827,recombinant avirulent salmonella vaccine strains with stable maintenance and high level expression of cloned genes in vivo.,"recombinant avirulent salmonella vaccine strains with stable maintenance and high level expression of cloned genes in vivo.. Salmonella typhimurium strains with deletion (delta) of the adenylate cyclase (cya) and cyclic AMP receptor protein (crp) genes are avirulent for mice and induce a high level of protective immunity to oral challenge with up to 10,000 times what would be a lethal dose of wild-type virulent S. typhimurium cells. This immunity begins as early as seven days after immunization and lasts for at least four months. S. typhimurium delta cya delta crp mutants stably maintain plasmids and give high-level expression of cloned gene products; in this they appear superior to other avirulent S. typhimurium strains. S. typhimurium delta cya delta crp strains with a delta asd mutation (abolishing production of aspartate beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase), have an obligate requirement for diaminopimelic acid (DAP). This strain can be used in conjunction with plasmid vectors lacking antibiotic resistance markers but having the wild-type asd+ gene from Streptococcus mutans to complement the delta asd chromosomal mutation. The Asd+ plasmid vector can be used to express a diversity of colonization and virulence antigens from other pathogens. In the delta cya delta crp delta asd S. typhimurium vaccine strain, the plasmid is completely stable in the absence of any exogenous selective pressure either in vitro or in vivo.",1989
s60828,characterization and vaccine potential of a novel recombinant coccidial antigen.,"characterization and vaccine potential of a novel recombinant coccidial antigen.. A cDNA clone derived from sporulated oocysts of Eimeria tenella and encoding the expression product GX3262 was identified using a monoclonal antibody raised against Eimeria acervulina sporozoites. The cDNA fragment containing the coccidial antigen gene was cloned in bacteriophage lambda gt11, transferred to a plasmid, and introduced into Escherichia coli for analysis of the gene products. The strain carrying the plasmid produced GX3262 as part of a fusion protein consisting of the first 1,006 amino acids of E. coli beta-galactosidase and 112 amino acids of the E. tenella protein of approximately 12 kilodaltons. Partially purified antigen, heat-killed recombinant bacterin, and live E. coli containing the recombinant coccidial antigen were used to immunize 1-week-old or newly hatched broiler chicks. Several immunization protocols were utilized, including boosts with partially purified beta-galactosidase-GX3262, bacterin, or small numbers of live E. tenella oocysts. After challenge with an experimental E. tenella infection, the birds were evaluated by scoring cecal lesions to determine the level of protection. The greatest degree of protection was seen after only a single immunization of 2-day-old birds with a live recombinant E. coli preparation. The results presented here identify GX3262 as a potential candidate coccidial vaccine antigen and provide evidence for the first time that newly hatched chickens can be successfully vaccinated with a recombinant antigen.",1989
s60976,virus vaccines: principles and prospects.,"virus vaccines: principles and prospects.. The present status of vaccination for controlling viral diseases is reviewed, and the needs and directions for future investigations are discussed. A survey of viral vaccines now in use has shown that knowledge about the viral agents and about the hosts' responses to infection was essential for their development. The steps needed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a viral vaccine are summarized; the final requirement for a successful vaccine is that it be administered in proper dosage and potency to the target populations. After general remarks on the proper use of current vaccines there follows an overview of various developments in creating new vaccines, along with the predicted time-frames for their coming into general use. Topics considered include vaccines to be administered locally at the portal of entry, subunit vaccines, viruses attenuated by genetic manipulation, use of viral vectors, vaccines developed by means of recombinant DNA, synthetic peptides, and anti-idiotype vaccines, as well as new vaccines being developed by more conventional methods.",1989
s60990,immunization of chickens with live escherichia coli expressing eimeria acervulina merozoite recombinant antigen induces partial protection against coccidiosis.,"immunization of chickens with live escherichia coli expressing eimeria acervulina merozoite recombinant antigen induces partial protection against coccidiosis.. Inoculation of chickens with live Escherichia coli N6405 transformants containing a plasmid which encodes ampicillin resistance and an immunodominant p250 surface antigen of Eimeria acervulina merozoites induced partial protection against challenge with live coccidia. The inoculation with E. coli transformants induced antigen-specific immunoglobulin and cell-mediated immune responses. Challenge with infective oocysts of Eimeria acervulina enhanced both immune parameters, indicating that administration of live E. coli transformants served to prime the immune system for recognition of specific epitopes on the 250-kilodalton protein. Although the mechanism of antigen presentation is unclear, the data suggest that in vivo expression of recombinant merozoite antigen is operative. After administration, no E. coli N6405 transformants could be recovered from intestinal or fecal materials of inoculated chickens, as assessed by enumeration on selective medium. However, ampicillin-resistant E. coli originating from the normal flora and harboring the gene sequences for both antibiotic resistance and Eimeria acervulina merozoite surface protein could be recovered from these chickens. Furthermore, normal-flora E. coli transformants were capable of generating functional beta-lactamase product, as evidenced by their resistance to ampicillin, and immunoreactive E. acervulina merozoite recombinant antigen, as revealed by immunofluorescence staining with p250-specific antiserum.",1989
s61182,m protein (m1) of influenza virus: antigenic analysis and intracellular localization with monoclonal antibodies.,"m protein (m1) of influenza virus: antigenic analysis and intracellular localization with monoclonal antibodies.. A panel of 16 monoclonal antibodies recognizing M protein (M1) of influenza virus was generated. Competition analyses resulted in localization of 14 monoclonal antibodies to three antigenic sites. Three monoclonal antibodies localized to site 1B recognized a peptide synthesized to M1 (residues 220 to 236) with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titers equivalent to or greater than that seen with purified M1; therefore, site 1B is located near the C terminus of M1. Sites 2 and 3 localize to the N-terminal half of M1. Antigenic variation of M proteins was seen when the monoclonal antibodies were tested against 14 strains of type A influenza viruses. Several monoclonal antibodies showed specific recognition of A/PR/8/34 and A/USSR/90/77 M proteins and little or no reactivity for all other strains tested. Immunofluorescence analysis with the monoclonal antibodies showed migration of M protein to the nucleus during the replicative cycle and demonstrated association of M protein with actin filaments in the cytoplasm. Use of a vaccinia virus recombinant containing the M-protein gene demonstrated migration of M protein to the nucleus in the absence of synthesis of gene products from other influenza virus RNA segments.",1989
s61212,generalized immunological recognition of the major merozoite surface antigen (gp195) of plasmodium falciparum.,"generalized immunological recognition of the major merozoite surface antigen (gp195) of plasmodium falciparum.. The antibody response to the Plasmodium falciparum major merozoite surface antigen (gp195) of congenic mouse strains differing in H-2 haplotype has been examined. All seven strains of mice were capable of producing gp195-specific antibodies. Generalized immune recognition of gp195 by mice of diverse H-2 haplotypes distinguished gp195 from the P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein and the 230-kDa and 48/45-kDa gamete surface antigens. However, the H-2 genetic locus appeared to influence the specificity of gp195-specific antibodies. Immunoblot patterns of mouse sera with parasite antigens revealed a complex pattern of reactivity with terminal and intermediate processing fragments of gp195. The majority of immunoblot bands observed were similar for all of the mouse strains; however, there were several strains that additionally recognized a few unique fragments or displayed more intense reactivities with specific processing fragments. These results suggest that while individuals of diverse major histocompatibility complex makeup are capable of recognizing the gp195 antigen, the recognition of specific gp195 B-cell and T-cell epitopes may be under control of the major histocompatibility complex.",1989
s61376,current status of the development of an aids vaccine.,"current status of the development of an aids vaccine.. It is commonly agreed that the development of a vaccine that would prove effective against infection by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, HIV, would be an important measure toward eliminating the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, AIDS. The biology of HIV is complex and very little is known regarding the host immune defenses against viral infection. The virus has evolved mechanisms to evade the immune system which would appear to make traditional vaccine approaches potentially inadequate. However, all of the diverse technologies which have recently been developed in the field of vaccinology have already been applied in large measure to this disease. These techniques include the use of subunits derived from the virus or by recombinant DNA methods, the use of peptides, the use of anti-idiotypes, and the use of various attenuated viruses which can be utilized as gene carriers. This review summarizes the status of these approaches in an attempt to give a critical overview of the field as it presently exists.",1989
s61696,"a dual expression system for the generation, analysis and purification of antibodies to a repeated sequence of the plasmodium falciparum antigen pf155/resa.","a dual expression system for the generation, analysis and purification of antibodies to a repeated sequence of the plasmodium falciparum antigen pf155/resa.. A novel dual expression system for the generation and analysis of immune responses to recombinant protein is described. The two expression systems are based on the IgG-binding domains (ZZ) of staphylococcal protein A (SpA) and the human serum albumin (HSA) binding domains (BB) of streptococcal protein G, respectively. Products of fusions with the ZZ region are used to generate an immune response against the recombinant peptide and the corresponding peptide fused to the BB region is used for analysis and purification of the specific antibodies. The protein A and protein G expression systems were used to produce fusion proteins with the repeated C terminal octapeptide subunit EENVEHDA of the Plasmodium falciparum merozoite derived protein Pf155/RESA. Rabbits were immunized with the protein A-derived fusion protein (designated ZZ-M1) and the antibody response was analyzed using the protein G-derived fusion protein (designated BB-M1). The rabbit antisera reacted with BB-M1 in both ELISA and immunoblotting. In addition, BB-M1 proved to be an efficient ligand for affinity purification of antibodies specific for the malaria peptide. Furthermore, the rabbit antisera reacted with Pf155/RESA both in merozoite extracts and when deposited in the membrane of parasite infected erythrocytes.",1989
s61748,mutants of pertussis toxin suitable for vaccine development.,"mutants of pertussis toxin suitable for vaccine development.. Immunization with chemically detoxified pertussis toxin can prevent severe whooping cough with an efficacy similar to that of the cellular pertussis vaccine, which normally gives unwanted side effects. To avoid the reversion to toxicity and the loss of immunogenicity that may follow chemical treatment of pertussis toxin, inactive toxins were constructed by genetic manipulation. A number of genetically engineered alleles of the pertussis toxin genes, constructed by replacing either one or two key amino acids within the enzymatically active S1 subunit, were introduced into the chromosome of strains of Bordetella pertussis, B. parapertussis, and B. bronchiseptica. These strains produce mutant pertussis toxin molecules that are nontoxic and immunogenic and that protect mice from the intracerebral challenge with virulent Bordetella pertussis. Such molecules are ideal for the development of new and safer vaccines against whooping cough.",1989
s61896,sequence analysis of the cloned streptococcal cell surface antigen i/ii.,"sequence analysis of the cloned streptococcal cell surface antigen i/ii.. The gene spa P (formerly designated as spa P1) encoding the Mr 185,000 surface antigen (I/II) of Streptococcus mutans, serotype c (NG5), has been sequenced. The gene (4683 bp) encodes a protein of 1561 amino acid residues including putative signal peptide (residues 1-38) and transmembrane (residues 1537-1556) sequences. The N-terminal region (60-550) has alanine-rich repeats and is predicted to be alpha-helical. However, the C-terminal region (800-1540) is proline-rich and favours an extended structure. Except for a short central variable region the sequences appear to be highly conserved for S. mutans serotype c. N-Terminal sequencing of separated antigen I and antigen II polypeptides suggests that the former represents the N-terminal and the latter the C-terminal portions of the intact antigen.",1989
s62027,cloning and expression of a protective antigen from the cattle tick boophilus microplus.,"cloning and expression of a protective antigen from the cattle tick boophilus microplus.. Glycoproteins located on the luminal surface of the plasma membrane of tick gut epithelial cells, when used to vaccinate cattle, are capable of stimulating an immune response that protects cattle against subsequent tick infestation. One such tick gut glycoprotein, designated Bm86, has been purified to homogeneity and the amino acid sequences of peptide fragments generated by endoproteinase Lys-C digestion have been determined. We report here the isolation and characterization of a cDNA that encodes Bm86. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA contains a 1982-base-pair open reading frame and predicts that Bm86 contains 650 amino acids including a 19-amino acid signal sequence and a 23-amino acid hydrophobic region adjacent to the carboxyl terminus. The main feature of the deduced protein sequence is the repeated pattern of 6 cysteine residues, suggesting the presence of several epidermal growth factor-like domains. A fusion protein consisting of 599 amino acids of Bm86 and 651 amino acids of beta-galactosidase was expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies. Ticks engorging on cattle vaccinated with these inclusion bodies were significantly damaged as a result of the immune response against the cloned antigen.",1989
s62245,"growth at sub-optimal temperatures allows the production of functional, antigen-binding fab fragments in escherichia coli.","growth at sub-optimal temperatures allows the production of functional, antigen-binding fab fragments in escherichia coli.. Expression in Escherichia coli of recombinant genes coding for the kappa-chain and the Fd fragment of an antibody directed against carcinoembryonic antigen gives rise to Fab dimers. These Fab fragments possess antibody activity, as demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as well as by ligand competition assay. Effective production of soluble Fab in Escherichia coli was achieved by a decrease in the growth temperature. Following a one step purification by anion exchange chromatography, the bacterially-produced Fab retains its activity at 4 degrees C for at least two months. The relatively simple methodology described in this study should be useful for the design and production of antibodies in bacteria.",1989
s62438,antipneumococcal effects of c-reactive protein and monoclonal antibodies to pneumococcal cell wall and capsular antigens.,"antipneumococcal effects of c-reactive protein and monoclonal antibodies to pneumococcal cell wall and capsular antigens.. Antibodies to pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides are well known for their ability to protect against pneumococcal infection. Recent studies indicate that antibodies to cell wall antigens, including pneumococcal surface protein A and the phosphocholine (PC) determinant of teichoic acids as well as human C-reactive protein (which also binds to PC), can protect mice against pneumococcal infection. In the present study we compared the protective effects of these agents as measured by mouse protection, the blood bactericidal assay, and clearance of pneumococci from the blood and peritoneal cavity. Our findings extend previous results indicating that human C-reactive protein and antibodies to noncapsular antigens are generally less protective than anticapsular antibodies. The new results obtained indicate the following: (i) mouse protection studies with intraperitoneal and intravenous infections provide very similar results; (ii) monoclonal immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a) antibodies to PC, like IgG1, IgG2b, and IgG3 antibodies to PC, are highly protective against pneumococcal infection in mice; (iii) human antibody to PC is able to protect against pneumococcal infection in mice; (iv) antibodies to PspA are effective at mediating blood and peritoneal clearance of pneumococci; (v) complement is required for the in vivo protective effects of both IgG and IgM antibodies to PC; (vi) IgG1, IgG2b, and IgG3 anti-PC antibodies all mediate complement-dependent lysis of PC-conjugated erythrocytes; and (vii) antibodies and human C-reactive proteins that are reactive with capsular antigens but not cell wall antigens are able to mediate significant antibacterial activity in the blood bactericidal assay.",1989
s62487,cloning of cdnas encoding a 28 kilodalton antigen of toxoplasma gondii.,"cloning of cdnas encoding a 28 kilodalton antigen of toxoplasma gondii.. By screening cDNA libraries in lambda gt11 with antibodies raised against the previously described protective F3G3 antigen of Toxoplasma gondii, and subsequently screening with nucleic acid probes, we have isolated cDNA clones that encode a 28 kDa antigen of T. gondii that is likely one of the two antigenic components of the F3G3 antigen. The gene apparently exists as a single copy in the tachyzoite haploid genome of the three strains of T. gondii examined. Northern blot analyses revealed that the cDNAs hybridize with a major T. gondii RNA species of 1.1 kb. Together the cDNAs encompass 1051 bp of cDNA sequence containing an open reading frame with the capacity to encode a 28 kDa protein. Antibodies that were affinity purified using recombinant fusion proteins produced by two of the clones reacted on protein blots of whole T. gondii lysate with a single antigen having an apparent molecular mass of 28 kDa. Both recombinant fusion proteins reacted with IgG antibodies in sera of mice and humans infected with T. gondii and therefore might be useful for the development of diagnostic assays for T. gondii infection.",1989
s62600,prediction of major histocompatibility complex binding regions of protein antigens by sequence pattern analysis.,"prediction of major histocompatibility complex binding regions of protein antigens by sequence pattern analysis.. We have previously experimentally analyzed the structural requirements for interaction between peptide antigens and mouse major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules of the d haplotype. We describe here two procedures devised to predict specifically the capacity of peptide molecules to interact with these MHC class II molecules (IAd and IEd). The accuracy of these procedures has been tested on a large panel of synthetic peptides of eukaryotic, prokaryotic, and viral origin, and also on a set of overlapping peptides encompassing the entire staphylococcal nuclease molecule. For both sets of peptides, IAd and IEd binding was successfully predicted in approximately 75% of the cases. This suggests that definition of such sequence """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""motifs"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" could be of general use in predicting potentially immunogenic peptide regions within proteins.",1989
s62610,improved recombinant lc16m0 or lc16m8 vaccinia virus successfully expressing hepatitis b surface antigen.,"improved recombinant lc16m0 or lc16m8 vaccinia virus successfully expressing hepatitis b surface antigen.. An attempt was made to develop a safe, efficacious live recombinant vaccine using low neurovirulent strains of vaccinia virus: LC16m0 (m0) or LC16m8 (m8). Recombinant vaccinia virus (RVV) was constructed by inserting the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) gene fused to a 7.5 kDa protein promoter (7.5 kDa promoter) within the vaccinia virus thymidine kinase (TK) gene using the m0 or m8 strain as vectors. These RVVs expressed significant amounts of HBsAg (1.1 microgram/2 X 10(5) cells) consisting of 24.5 and 28 kDa (glycosylated) proteins. HBsAg produced by RVV (vaccinia HBsAg) had physical properties very similar to plasma-derived HBsAg. Considering the safety of RVVs from m0 or m8 that have been constructed with HBsAg without the addition of a promoter and the high induction of anti-HBs antibody with RVV from m0 strain in rabbits, the RVVs constructed in the present study are likely to form the basis of a safe live RVV vaccine for hepatitis B virus (HBV).",1989
s63182,serological responses in cats vaccinated with felv iscom and an inactivated felv vaccine.,"serological responses in cats vaccinated with felv iscom and an inactivated felv vaccine.. Various approaches have been considered for generation of effective and safe vaccines against retroviruses, including HIV, with limited success. In the present vaccination study, encompassing 137 household cats, we have composed an experimental ISCOM subunit vaccine containing gp70 of feline leukaemia virus (FeLV)--the external glycosylated envelope protein, and the transmembrane protein p15E, with a commercial available inactivated FeLV vaccine (Leukocell). The two vaccines were estimated to contain approximately the same amount of gp70 antigen and the cats were immunized three times according to the recommendations of the commercial vaccine. A control preparation not containing gp70 or p15E was also included. During the observation period of 200 days all cats remained healthy and no virus was isolated during the isolation attempts. The serological responses were measured in ELISA, membrane immunofluorescence (MIF) and virus neutralization (VN) tests. In contrast to the cats in the other groups almost all ISCOM-vaccinated cats responded by seroconversion or increased titres in the three tests. The development of specific antibodies to gp70 and p15E were confirmed in Western blot. These results clearly illustrate the potential of the ISCOM structure for the development of safe and effective vaccines against retroviruses.",1989
s63221,induction of antibodies to a tumor-associated antigen by immunization with a whole melanoma cell vaccine.,"induction of antibodies to a tumor-associated antigen by immunization with a whole melanoma cell vaccine.. Urinary-tumor-associated antigen (U-TAA) is a glycoprotein present in the urine of melanoma patients. Previous studies have addressed the role of U-TAA in immunoprognosis. The present investigation was undertaken to determine whether the administration of whole melanoma cell vaccine (MCV) could induce the formation of anti-(U-TAA) antibodies in melanoma patients. The subjects of this study were stage II and III melanoma patients receiving MCV alone or in conjunction with cyclophosphamide. Anti-(U-TAA) IgM and IgG antibody levels were determined by enzyme immunoassay in sequential serum samples from 15 stage II and III melanoma patients receiving MCV. U-TAA purified from the urine of a melanoma patient was used as a target in this assay. The mean anti-(U-TAA) IgM titer prior to vaccination was similar to that of a non-vaccinated melanoma control group (1:1138 +/- 214, n = 15 vs 1:1334 +/- 254, n = 7; P = 0.375) but prevaccination IgG levels were generally higher than in the control group (1:3984 +/- 602 vs 1:2595 +/- 423; 0.1 greater than P greater than 0.05). While only 6 of the 15 patients demonstrated a rise in levels of IgG antibodies (mean 1:2964 +/- 1047 pre-MCV to 1:9958 +/- 2677 post MCV, P less than 0.01), 11 of the 15 patients demonstrated a greater than twofold rise in their anti-(U-TAA) IgM titers following vaccination (1:1051 +/- 259 pre-MCV to 1:2518 +/- 576 post-MCV; P less than 0.005). In addition, patients with visceral metastases consistently elicited anti-(U-TAA) responses equivalent to those with more limited disease. Concomitant administration of cyclophosphamide did not affect the response rates of peak antibody levels. The possibility that these antibody responses were actually against histocompatibility locus antigens (HLA) (contaminating our U-TAA preparation) was ruled out because the target antigen (U-TAA) was devoid of HLA, and because the induction of anti-(U-TAA) antibodies did not correlate with the induction of anti-HLA antibodies. These results demonstrate augmentation of anti-(U-TAA) IgM and IgG antibodies by immunization with the MCV.",1989
s63365,sequence analysis of the wall-associated protein precursor of streptococcus mutans antigen a.,"sequence analysis of the wall-associated protein precursor of streptococcus mutans antigen a.. The nucleotide sequence has been determined for the Streptococcus mutans wall-associated protein A (wapA) gene from serotype c strains Ingbritt and GS5. The nucleotide sequence for each wapA gene was virtually identical, although the gene from strain GS5 contained a 24 base pair deletion. A 29 amino acid signal peptide was specified by each wapA gene with a mature protein of 424 amino acids (Mr, 45,276) for strain Ingbritt and 416 amino acids (Mr, 44,846) for strain GS5. In the C-terminal region of the wall-associated protein A, considerable sequence similarity was found with the membrane anchor region of proteins from other Gram-positive organisms such as the group A streptococcal M protein and the group G streptococcal IgG binding protein. Adjacent to the proposed membrane anchor is a highly hydrophilic region which may span the cell wall; both sequence data and experimental evidence indicate the existence of a region immediately outside the wall at which proteolytic cleavage occurs to release antigen A of Mr 29,000 into the culture supernatant. Thus, the wall-associated protein A is a precursor of the 29,000 Mr antigen A.",1989
s63368,"molecular characterization of a surface protein antigen gene from serotype c streptococcus mutans, implicated in dental caries.","molecular characterization of a surface protein antigen gene from serotype c streptococcus mutans, implicated in dental caries.. The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene for a cell-surface protein antigen (PAc) of Streptococcus mutans MT8148 (serotype c) was determined. The pac gene consisted of 4695 bp and coded for a 170773D protein. The pac gene product contained a putative 38 amino acid signal peptide, resulting in a 166817D mature protein. A potential promoter sequence and a putative Shine-Dalgarno sequence preceded the open reading frame. Two internal repeating amino acid sequences were present in the PAc. One repeating region located in the N-terminal region was rich in alanine, and the other located in the central region was rich in proline. Southern blot analysis under the less stringent condition (allowing up to 35% base mismatch) revealed that the probe covering the proline-rich region hybridized to DNA preparations from strains of Streptococcus cricetus, Streptococcus sobrinus and Streptococcus downei as well as Streptococcus mutans.",1989
s63953,tumor antigens defined by cloned immunological probes are highly polymorphic and are not detected on autologous normal cells.,"tumor antigens defined by cloned immunological probes are highly polymorphic and are not detected on autologous normal cells.. We have isolated UV light-induced and spontaneous tumors along with nonmalignant cells and tissues from each host. CD8+ CTL clones generated to a number of highly immunogenic UV-induced tumors did not react with autologous normal fibroblasts nor with autologous second tumors. Using up to 25 independently induced tumors as targets, these CTL clones were found to be uniquely specific for the particular tumor used for immunization even when multiple tumors isolated from the same animals were used as targets. In addition to this extensive antigenic diversity of independently induced tumors, we found that a single cancer cell can express multiple independent antigens that were uniquely expressed on the tumor but were not detectable on autologous nonmalignant fibroblasts. A poorly immunogenic spontaneous tumor was also found to express an antigen that was uniquely specific for the immunizing tumor in that it was absent from any of 25 other tumors tested. This antigen was recognized by a mAb and not detected on autologous nonmalignant fibroblasts or on an autologous second spontaneous tumor. These findings demonstrate that syngeneic CTL clones or mAbs can define unique antigens on UV-induced or spontaneous tumors. The use of autologous nonmalignant fibroblast targets made it unlikely that these antigens were widely expressed on normal cells. The availability of cloned immunological probes to antigens on tumors isolated with autologous normal cells will allow a reliable identification of the genetic origins of unique antigens on experimentally induced and spontaneous tumors and permit a decisive answer to whether these unique antigens are encoded by normal genes or by genes that have undergone somatic mutations; i.e., whether these antigens are truly tumor specific.",1989
s64164,cloning and analysis of the gene encoding the 230-kilodalton merozoite surface antigen of plasmodium yoelii.,"cloning and analysis of the gene encoding the 230-kilodalton merozoite surface antigen of plasmodium yoelii.. The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene for the 230-kDa precursor to the major merozoite surface antigens (PMMSA) of Plasmodium yoelii YM has been determined. A single open reading frame of 5316 bp encodes a protein of calculated molecular mass 197,000. The deduced amino acid sequence contains potential signal peptide and membrane anchor sequences of 19 and 18 residues, respectively, and a region of six tandemly repeated tetrapeptides, Gly-Ala-Val-Pro. Comparison with the 195-kDa Plasmodium falciparum analogue (Pf195) at the amino acid level indicated an overall homology of approximately 30%, with areas of as high as 60% conservation. The tripeptide repeats present near the N-terminus of the Pf195 antigen are absent from the Py230 sequence. The PMMSA can be divided into 22 blocks based upon interspecies amino acid conservation.",1989
s64295,antibody response and characteristics of antibodies in women immunized with three contraceptive vaccines inducing antibodies against human chorionic gonadotropin.,"antibody response and characteristics of antibodies in women immunized with three contraceptive vaccines inducing antibodies against human chorionic gonadotropin.. Data are presented on antibody titers generated in 88 women immunized with three formulations of antihuman chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) vaccine, namely, beta-hCG (formulation B); beta-hCG associated with alpha-subunit of ovine luteinizing hormone (LH) (formulation A) and beta-hCG + beta-ovine LH (formulation M), each linked to tetanus toxoid and cholera toxin chain B as carriers. Each formulation was tested at two dose levels (100 and 500 micrograms). All women without exception developed anti-hCG antibodies having hCG-binding capacity above 20 ng mL-1 (0.5 nM), a level considered to be the threshold for prevention of pregnancy. Formulations A and B gave relatively better immunogenic response in human subjects than M. In each case, the antibody response was reversible. The mean duration of response above 20 ng was 35 to 37 weeks for formulation A, 34 weeks for B, and 17 to 20 weeks for M. Antibodies induced by three formulations of the vaccine had high-affinity (Ka 10(9)-10(10)M-1) for binding with hCG. They were devoid of cross-reaction with human follicle-stimulating hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone but, as expected, cross-reacted with human LH. Antibodies were competent to block the hCG induced ovarian hyperemia.",1989
s64469,development of heat-stable recombinant rinderpest vaccine.,"development of heat-stable recombinant rinderpest vaccine.. Recombinant vaccinia virus (RVV) containing the full-length cDNA of rinderpest virus (RV)-haemagglutinin (H) gene was constructed. The H gene was inserted into the attenuated vaccine strain of vaccinia virus (VV), Le 16 m0, with two different promoters, namely cowpox virus A-type inclusion body (ATI) promoter or VV 7.5 kilodalton (P7.5) promoter. These RVVs produced the same sized fully glycosylated RV-H protein in RK 13 cells as that of the authentic RV-H. Their heat stability in the lyophylized state was similar to that of the parental VV. All rabbits immunized with these RVVs produced virus neutralizing (VN) antibody to RV as well as anti RV-H antibody. Four weeks after immunization, these animals were challenged with RV intravenously. None of the RVV-immunized rabbits developed any clinical signs of RV infection except one which was immunized with RVV containing the ATI promoter and developed low VN titer. These results indicate the possibility of developing a heat-stable recombinant vaccine for the eradication of rinderpest in tropical countries without cold storage systems.",1989
s64542,chromosomal locations of the gene coding for the cd3 (t3) gamma subunit of the human and mouse cd3/t-cell antigen receptor complexes.,"chromosomal locations of the gene coding for the cd3 (t3) gamma subunit of the human and mouse cd3/t-cell antigen receptor complexes.. The gene coding for the Mr 26000 gamma chain of the human CD3 (T3) antigen/T-cell antigen receptor complex was mapped to chromosome band 11q23 by using a cDNA clone (pJ6T3 gamma-2), by in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes and by Southern blot analysis of a panel of human-rodent somatic cell hybrids. The mouse homolog, here termed Cdg-3, was mapped to chromosome 9 using the mouse gamma cDNA clone pB10.AT3 gamma-1 and a panel of mouse-hamster somatic cell hybrids. Similar locations for the CD3 delta genes have been described previously. Thus, the corporate results indicate that the CD3 gamma and delta genes have remained together since they duplicated about 200 million years ago.",1987
s64591,insertions in the hepatitis b surface antigen. effect on assembly and secretion of 22-nm particles from mammalian cells.,"insertions in the hepatitis b surface antigen. effect on assembly and secretion of 22-nm particles from mammalian cells.. The envelope protein of hepatitis B virus carrying the surface antigen, HBsAg, has the unique property of mobilizing cellular lipids into spherical or elongated particles, about 22 nm in diameter, which are secreted from mammalian cells. We have created mutant envelope proteins by insertion of various sequences of different lengths into two regions of the S gene encoding the major envelope protein. S genes carrying inserts in phase with HBsAg were expressed in mouse L cells from the simian virus 40 early promoter. Various single or double inserts in the two major hydrophilic domains of HBsAg were compatible with secretion of 22-nm particles. In all mutant envelope proteins studied, the HBsAg domains required for intracellular aggregation appeared to be intact. However, assembly into particles was not sufficient to assure transport into the extracellular space. The 22-nm HBsAg particle may be a useful vehicle for the export and presentation of foreign peptide sequences.",1987
s64634,pancreatic neoplasia induced by sv40 t-antigen expression in acinar cells of transgenic mice.,"pancreatic neoplasia induced by sv40 t-antigen expression in acinar cells of transgenic mice.. Three lines of transgenic mice were produced that develop pancreatic neoplasms as a consequence of expression of an elastase I-SV40 T-antigen fusion gene in the acinar cells. A developmental analysis suggests at least a two-stage process in the ontogeny of this disease. The first stage is a T antigen-induced, preneoplastic state characterized by a progression from hyperplasia to dysplasia of the exocrine pancreas, by an increased percentage of tetraploid cells, and by an arrest in acinar cell differentiation. The second stage is characterized by the formation of tumor nodules that appear to be monoclonal, because they have discrete aneuploid DNA contents. The cells within the nodules as compared to normal pancreatic tissue have less total RNA by a factor of 5, less pancreas-specific messenger RNA by a factor of about 50, and increased levels of T-antigen messenger RNA. A tumor cell line has been derived that retains both pancreatic and neoplastic properties.",1987
s64639,expression of biologically active and antigenically authentic parainfluenza type 3 virus hemagglutinin-neuraminidase glycoprotein by a recombinant baculovirus.,"expression of biologically active and antigenically authentic parainfluenza type 3 virus hemagglutinin-neuraminidase glycoprotein by a recombinant baculovirus.. The hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) gene of human type 3 parainfluenza virus has been inserted into a baculovirus expression vector under the control of the polyhedrin promoter. HN protein produced in insect cells by the recombinant baculovirus appeared to be glycosylated, was transported to the cell surface, and was biologically active. All of the HN epitopes previously mapped functionally to a region(s) involved in neuraminidase and/or hemagglutination activities were conformationally unaltered on the recombinant protein. The HN produced in this system also induced a protective immune response in immunized cotton rats. From these studies we conclude that the HN expressed in insect cells represents a source of authentic HN glycoprotein suitable for structural analysis and immunization.",1987

The genetic basis of attenuation of the poliovirus type 3 vaccine strain P3/Leon 12a1b has been investigated by comparing the nucleotide sequence of this strain with that of its neurovirulent progenitor P3/Leon/37 and by constructing recombinants between these two viruses using infectious cDNAs. Preliminary results suggest that attenuation is caused by just two point mutations, one occurring in the 5' non-coding region and the other causing an amino acid change in coat protein VP3.",1987
s65047,human cytomegalovirus encodes a glycoprotein homologous to mhc class-i antigens.,"human cytomegalovirus encodes a glycoprotein homologous to mhc class-i antigens.. Primary infection with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is persistent and widespread, with symptoms that are mostly subclinical but can cause serious illness or death, particularly in immunosuppressed patients. Recently, proteins from HCMV were shown to bind beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-m) a protein that is normally found associated with the class-I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens, which are essential for self-non-self recognition in the immune response. These findings led to the proposal that the virus may use beta 2-m binding as an infection mechanism. Here we present evidence from DNA sequence analysis that HCMV encodes a molecule similar to the MHC class-I antigens of higher eucaryotes, and propose that this protein is responsible for the observed beta 2-m binding. The deduced amino-acid sequence of the HCMV class-I-like protein reveals conservation of typical features of class-I structure, but we predict that the gene is not spliced, in contrast to the cellular genes.",1988
s65132,"cloning of genes encoding a 15,000-dalton peptidoglycan-associated outer membrane lipoprotein and an antigenically related 15,000-dalton protein from haemophilus influenzae.","cloning of genes encoding a 15,000-dalton peptidoglycan-associated outer membrane lipoprotein and an antigenically related 15,000-dalton protein from haemophilus influenzae.. We have cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli a gene encoding a 15,000-apparent-molecular-weight peptidoglycan-associated outer membrane lipoprotein (PAL) of Haemophilus influenzae. The nucleotide sequence of this gene encodes an open reading frame of 153 codons with a predicted mature protein of 134 amino acids. The amino acid composition and sequence of the predicted mature protein agree with the chemically determined composition and partial amino acid sequence of PAL purified from H. influenzae outer membranes. We have also identified a second gene from H. influenzae that encodes a second 15,000-apparent-molecular-weight protein which is recognized by antiserum against PAL. This protein has been shown to be a lipoprotein. The nucleotide sequence of this gene encodes an open reading frame of 154 codons with a predicted mature protein of 136 amino acids and has limited sequence homology with that of the gene encoding PAL. Southern hybridization analysis indicates that both genes exist as single copies in H. influenzae chromosomal DNA. Both genes encode polypeptides which have amino-terminal sequences similar to those of reported membrane signal peptides and are associated primarily with the outer membrane when expressed in E. coli.",1988
s65177,infection immunity of piglets to either vp3 or vp7 outer capsid protein confers resistance to challenge with a virulent rotavirus bearing the corresponding antigen.,"infection immunity of piglets to either vp3 or vp7 outer capsid protein confers resistance to challenge with a virulent rotavirus bearing the corresponding antigen.. A single-gene substitution reassortant 11-1 was generated from two porcine rotaviruses, OSU (serotype 5) and Gottfried (serotype 4). This reassortant derived 10 genes, including gene 4 encoding VP3, from the OSU strain and only gene 9, encoding a major neutralization glycoprotein (VP7), from the Gottfried strain and was thus designated VP3:5; VP7:4. Oral administration of this reassortant to colostrum-deprived gnotobiotic newborn pigs induced a high level of neutralizing antibodies not only to Gottfried VP7 but also to OSU VP3, thus demonstrating that VP3 is as potent an immunogen as VP7 in inducing neutralizing antibodies during experimental oral infection. Gnotobiotic piglets infected previously with the reassortant were completely resistant to oral challenge with the virulent Gottfried strain (VP3:4; VP7:4), as indicated by failure of symptoms to develop and lack of virus shedding. Similarly, prior infection with the reassortant induced almost complete protection against diarrhea and significant restriction of virus replication after oral challenge with the virulent OSU strain (VP3:5; VP7:5). Thus, it appears that (i) the immune system of the piglet responds equally well to two rotavirus outer capsid proteins, VP3 and VP7, during primary enteric rotavirus infection; (ii) antibody to VP3 and antibody to VP7 are each associated with resistance to diarrhea; and (iii) infection with a reassortant rotavirus bearing VP3 and VP7 neutralization antigens derived from two viruses of different serotype induces immunity to both parental viruses. The relevance of these findings to the development of effective reassortant rotavirus vaccines is discussed.",1988
s65230,expression of hla-dr antigen in human class ii mutant b-cell lines by double infection with retrovirus vectors.,"expression of hla-dr antigen in human class ii mutant b-cell lines by double infection with retrovirus vectors.. A new retrovirus vector containing the gene for hygromycin B resistance (hyg) as a selectable marker under the control of an internal simian virus 40 promoter was constructed. It was used, together with an analogous previously described vector, DO1, which contains the gene for G418 resistance, to introduce and express the genes for the two chains of a human class II major histocompatibility complex antigen in NIH 3T3 cells. In addition, these vectors were used to express DR antigens in two human mutant B-lymphoblastoid cell lines, one of which was deleted for both alleles of the DR alpha gene and the other of which expressed no class II antigens because of a genetic defect in a putative trans-acting regulatory factor.",1987
s65285,a vaccine strain of pseudorabies virus with deletions in the thymidine kinase and glycoprotein x genes.,"a vaccine strain of pseudorabies virus with deletions in the thymidine kinase and glycoprotein x genes.. A pseudorabies virus (PRV) mutant with deletions in genes for glycoprotein X (gX) and thymidine kinase, designated delta GX delta TK, was constructed and evaluated as a vaccine for protecting swine against PRV-induced mortality. Doses greater than or equal to 10(3) plaque-forming units (PFU) of this strain given to mice provided protection from challenge exposure with virulent PRV. Sera tested from mice inoculated with delta GX delta TK had high titers of neutralizing antibody to PRV, but reactivity in the same sera was not significantly different from that in sera from noninoculated mice (controls) when sera from both groups were evaluated by use of an ELISA with gX antigen produced in Escherichia coli. Compared with noninoculated pigs (controls), those given delta GX delta TK (greater than or equal to 10(2) PFU) were protected completely from lethal challenge exposure, without experiencing adverse effects on weight gain and with reduction of shedding of virulent challenge virus. Serotest results indicated that, although inoculated pigs responded with strong neutralizing antibody titers, the response of delta GX delta TK-inoculated pigs to gX, as determined by ELISA before challenge exposure, was not significantly greater than the ELISA values obtained from control pigs. The ELISA values from a group of pigs inoculated with a commercially available vaccine were significantly (P less than 0.05) higher than those of control pigs. The experimental vaccine, delta GX delta TK, was avirulent for mice, swine, and sheep, but was mildly virulent for calves (mortality, 1 of 12) and more virulent for dogs (mortality, 3 of 6) and cats (mortality, 2 of 6).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1987
s65749,the contribution of cysteine residues to antigenicity and extent of processing of herpes simplex virus type 1 glycoprotein d.,"the contribution of cysteine residues to antigenicity and extent of processing of herpes simplex virus type 1 glycoprotein d.. Glycoprotein D (gD) is an envelope component of herpes simplex virus types 1 (gD-1) and 2 (gD-2). The gD-1 polypeptide contains seven cysteine residues among its 369 amino acids; six are located on the N-terminal or luminal portion of the glycoprotein, and a seventh is located in the transmembrane region. Previous studies used a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to define gD epitopes as continuous or discontinuous. Purified gD, denatured by reduction and alkylation, loses discontinuous epitopes, whereas continuous epitopes are retained. The contribution of disulfide bonds to maintenance of discontinuous epitopes is, therefore, significant. In the present study, our objective was to determine the contribution of individual cysteine residues to folding of gD-1 into its native conformation. Site-directed oligonucleotide mutagenesis was used to create seven mutants, each with a serine residue replacing a cysteine. The mutated genes were cloned into a eucaryotic expression vector and transfected into COS-1 cells, and the proteins were separated by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by immunoblotting. Replacement of cysteine 7 (residue 333) had only a minimal effect on the antigenic properties of gD-1. In contrast, replacement of any one of the other six cysteine residues resulted in either a major reduction or a complete loss of binding of those MAbs that recognize discontinuous epitopes, with no effect on the binding of MAbs which recognize continuous epitopes. These mutations also had profound effects on the extent of oligosaccharide processing of gD-1. This was determined by digestion of the expressed proteins with various endoglycosidases, followed by electrophoresis and Western blotting (immunoblotting) to observe any mobility changes. Three mutant gD proteins which did not express discontinuous epitopes contained only high-mannose-type oligosaccharides, suggesting that processing had not proceeded beyond the precursor stage. Two mutant forms of gD exhibited reduced binding of MAbs to discontinuous epitopes. A small proportion of the molecules which accumulated at 48 h posttransfection contained complex oligosaccharides. One mutant exhibited reduced binding of MAbs to discontinuous epitopes, but was present at 48 h posttransfection only in the precursor form. The cysteine 7 mutant was processed to the same extent as wild-type gD. We conclude that the first six cysteine residues are critical to the correct folding, antigenic structure, and processing of gD-1, and we speculate that they form three disulfide-bonded pairs.",1988
s65902,genomic and antigenic characterization of avipoxviruses.,"genomic and antigenic characterization of avipoxviruses.. A permanent cell line of avian origin, QT-35, was used for the propagation of avipoxvirus isolates, including juncopox, pigeon pox, and field and vaccine strains of fowlpox viruses. The genomes of these avipoxvirus isolates were compared by restriction enzyme analysis using BamHI and HindIII endonuclease digestion and subsequent agarose gel electrophoresis. The genetic profiles of the virus strains were very similar, with a high proportion of comigrating fragments, although most strains could still be distinguished; therefore, these avipoxviruses appear to be closely related. Similar results were obtained when the immunogenic proteins of 6 fowlpox virus strains were examined by immunoblotting. Although the majority of the antigens were common, the strains could be differentiated by unique proteins of differing electrophoretic mobilities.",1988

An oral live attenuated Shigella flexneri vaccine candidate strain was constructed by making it auxotrophic and dependent on aromatic metabolites not available in mammalian tissues. An aroD gene of Escherichia coli K12 strain NK 5131, inactivated by insertion in it of the Tn 10 transposon, was transduced using phage P1 into a virulent S. flexneri serotype Y strain (Sfl 1) isolated from a patient with bacillary dysentery. One of the transductant strains Sfl 114 was found to invade HeLa cells in vitro, to cause plaque formation in HeLa monolayers (i.e. maintain intracellular multiplication in vitro), but to be unable to cause keratoconjunctivitis in guinea-pig eyes. When the strain was fed to Macacca fascicularis monkeys it was well tolerated, excreted for 1-4 days, and found to elicit a local intestinal sIgA and serum IgA, IgM and IgG responses. Monkeys challenged with 100 ID50 dose (1 X 10(11) bacteria) of the virulent parent Sfl 1 strain were completely protected from development of diarrhoea. Coloscopy of the monkeys and the sampling of intestinal biopsies showed that the vaccine protected against the surface epithelial erosions and ulcerations seen in unimmunized monkeys. Killing of invading virulent shigellae apparently took place intracellularly in the mucosa suggesting that cellular immune mechanisms played a role in the elicited host defence. The constructed S. flexneri Sfl 114 strain has the properties of a promising shigella vaccine and will next be the subject of studies with human volunteers.",1988
s66042,sv40 large tumor antigen forms a specific complex with the product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene.,"sv40 large tumor antigen forms a specific complex with the product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene.. Monkey cells synthesizing SV40 large T antigen were lysed and the extracts immunoprecipitated with either monoclonal anti-T antibody or monoclonal antibody to p110-114, the product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb). T and p110-114 coprecipitated in each case, implying that the proteins are complexed with each other. Substitution and internal deletion mutants of T that contain structural alterations in a ten residue, transformation-controlling domain failed to complex with p110-114. In contrast, T mutants bearing structural changes outside of this domain bound to p110-114. These results are consistent with a model for transformation by SV40 which, at least in part, involves T/p110-114 complex formation and the perturbation of Rb protein and/or T function.",1988
s66260,cloning and expression of the mycobacterium bovis bcg gene for extracellular alpha antigen.,"cloning and expression of the mycobacterium bovis bcg gene for extracellular alpha antigen.. The gene for the extracellular alpha antigen of Mycobacterium bovis BCG was cloned by using a single probe restricted to G or C in the third position. This technique should have great potential for the isolation of mycobacterial antigen genes. The gene analysis revealed that the alpha antigen gene encoded 323 amino acid residues, including 40 amino acids for signal peptide followed by 283 amino acids for mature protein. This is the first report on the structure of the mycobacterial signal peptide. The promoter-like sequence and ribosome-binding site were observed upstream of the open reading frame. In the coding region, the third position of the codon showed high G + C content (86%). The gene was expressed as an unfused protein in Escherichia coli by using an E. coli expression vector. This protein, which reacted with polyclonal antibody raised against alpha antigen from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, would be applicable to the immunodiagnosis of tuberculosis.",1988
s66343,construction of recombinant fowlpox viruses as vectors for poultry vaccines.,"construction of recombinant fowlpox viruses as vectors for poultry vaccines.. Plasmid vectors have been constructed which allow the construction of infectious fowlpox virus (FPV) recombinants expressing foreign genes. The foreign genes were inserted within the thymidine kinase (TK) gene of FPV contained in these vectors. To facilitate the selection of recombinants the Escherichia coli xanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (Ecogpt) gene was developed as a dominant selectable marker. This marker operates in a wide variety of cell types and obviates the need for TK- cell lines for selection of TK- recombinants when foreign genes have been inserted within the TK gene of FPV. The general approach adopted was to construct plasmid vectors in which the FPV TK was interrupted by the Ecogpt gene under the control of a poxvirus promoter in tandem with a gene of interest under the control of another poxvirus promoter. Selection of viruses expressing the Ecogpt gene simultaneously selects for recombinants carrying both the Ecogpt gene and the gene of interest. Using this approach a series of plasmid vectors was constructed in which the FPV TK gene was interrupted by the Ecogpt gene under the control of the P7.5 vaccinia virus promoter in tandem with the A/PR/8/34 haemagglutinin gene under the control of the PL11 vaccinia virus promoter. A recombinant FPV constructed using these plasmids had the expected genome arrangement, expressed influenza haemagglutinin, and induced haemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies when inoculated into chickens. These techniques should allow the construction of a variety of recombinant FPVs expressing poultry vaccine antigens. Such recombinants should be a very cost-effective means of delivering vaccines to poultry.",1988
s66420,placebo-controlled study with subunit herpes simplex virus vaccine in subjects suffering from frequent herpetic recurrences.,"placebo-controlled study with subunit herpes simplex virus vaccine in subjects suffering from frequent herpetic recurrences.. The safety and efficacy of a subunit herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 vaccine were tested in a small-scale double-blind trial carried out in a group of 42 volunteers suffering from frequent recurrences of herpetic lesions. The patients were paired according to sex, age, type of virus isolated, previous history of the disease and some non-specific immunological markers. One member of each pair received repeated doses of HSV vaccine, the other a placebo. Clinical reactions were mild. Antibody responses following the vaccination were generally low and were almost entirely limited to subjects suffering from HSV-2 lesions. A majority of the patients exhibited improvement of their condition during the postvaccination period. These improvements were, however, nearly equally distributed between the vaccine and placebo groups.",1988
s66500,synthesis and processing of the marek's disease herpesvirus b antigen glycoprotein complex.,"synthesis and processing of the marek's disease herpesvirus b antigen glycoprotein complex.. The Marek's disease herpesvirus B antigen (MDHV-B) complex was previously immunologically identified and molecularly characterized as a set of three glycoproteins designated gp100, gp60, and gp49 on the basis of apparent molecular weight and immunoprecipitation with both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. Immunoprecipitation analysis, previously with polyclonal and more recently with monoclonal antibodies, of infected cell lysates labeled with [35S]methionine in the presence of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, revealed two putative precursor molecules of 88,000 daltons (pr88) and 44,000 daltons (pr44). High-resolution pulse-chase studies revealed that gp100 was a glycosylated intermediate which was processed to yield gp60 and gp49. This cleavage was inhibited by monensin, an inhibitor of glycoprotein processing. Endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidases F and H (endo-F, endo-H) reduced gp100 to pr88, indicating that the latter is an intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway. These same enzymes reduced gp49, and to a lesser extent gp60, to pr44, suggesting that pr44 is their polypeptide backbone. Significant support for this concept is the fact that the same monoclonal antibody recognized all three molecules, gp60, gp49, and pr44. In the presence of monensin, terminal addition of complex sugars was also prevented, since gp60 was replaced by a slightly faster migrating component which was insensitive to both endo-F and endo-H. Cell-free translation of infected-cell mRNA, followed by immunoprecipitation analysis with either polyclonal or monoclonal antibody, resulted in detection of a putative unglycosylated precursor polypeptide of 44,000 daltons. Since pr88 was not the initial precursor polypeptide of the MDHV-B complex, its existence may have resulted from dimerization of pr44. Again, detection of both pr88 and pr44 with the same monoclonal antibody is consistent with this interpretation. These collective data obtained from the cell-free and in vivo studies with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies reactive with MDHV-B are consistent with the concept that pr44, the initial gene product, dimerizes to form pr88 and demonstrate that pr88 is actually a processing intermediate glycosylated to gp100, another processing intermediate, which is then processed to gp60 and gp49.",1988
s66503,"molecular and antigenic characterization of porcine rotavirus ym, a possible new rotavirus serotype.","molecular and antigenic characterization of porcine rotavirus ym, a possible new rotavirus serotype.. In 1983, we isolated a porcine rotavirus (strain YM) that was prevalent in several regions of Mexico, as judged by the frequency of its characteristic electropherotype. By a focus reduction neutralization test, rotavirus YM was clearly distinguished from prototype rotavirus strains belonging to serotypes 1 (Wa), 2 (S2), 3 (SA11), 4 (ST3), 5 (OSU), and 6 (NCDV). Minor, one-way cross-neutralization (1 to 5%) was observed when antisera to the various rotavirus strains were incubated with rotavirus YM. In addition, the YM virus was not neutralized by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies with specificity to serotypes 1, 2, 3, and 5. The subgroup of the virus was determined to be I by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To characterize the serotype-specific glycoprotein of the virus at the molecular level, we cloned and sequenced the gene coding for VP7. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with reported homologous sequences from human and animal rotavirus strains belonging to six different serotypes further supported the distinct immunological identity of the YM VP7 protein.",1988
s66647,amino acid sequence of the serine-repeat antigen (sera) of plasmodium falciparum determined from cloned cdna.,"amino acid sequence of the serine-repeat antigen (sera) of plasmodium falciparum determined from cloned cdna.. We report the isolation of cDNA clones for a Plasmodium falciparum gene that encodes the complete amino acid sequence of a previously identified exported blood stage antigen. The Mr of this antigen protein had been determined by sodium dodecylsulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, by different workers, to be 113,000, 126,000, and 140,000. We show, by cDNA nucleotide sequence analysis, that this antigen gene encodes a 989 amino acid protein (111 kDa) that contains a potential signal peptide, but not a membrane anchor domain. In the FCR3 strain the serine content of the protein was 11%, of which 57% of the serine residues were localized within a 201 amino acid sequence that included 35 consecutive serine residues. The protein also contained three possible N-linked glycosylation sites and numerous possible O-linked glycosylation sites. The mRNA was abundant during late trophozoite-schizont parasite stages. We propose to identity this antigen, which had been called p126, by the acronym SERA, serine-repeat antigen, based on its complete structure. The usefulness of the cloned cDNA as a source of a possible malaria vaccine is considered in view of the previously demonstrated ability of the antigen to induce parasite-inhibitory antibodies and a protective immune response in Saimiri monkeys.",1988
s66669,polyvalent recombinant antigens: a new vaccine strategy.,polyvalent recombinant antigens: a new vaccine strategy.. Recombinant DNA technology can be used to produce individual proteins from infectious organisms and these have the potential to be used as subunit vaccines. In many cases however these proteins display a low immunogenicity. One reason for this might be the poor presentation of the antigen to the cells of the immune system. A number of new recombinant DNA approaches are now being tried to improve the production and the presentation of antigens. One method is to use a carrier protein encoded by a retrotransposon of yeast called the Ty element. This protein can be linked to a wide range of viral antigens via the construction of hybrid genes. The fusion proteins assemble in yeast into 60 nm virus-like particles (VLPs) that display the additional antigens on the surface. These hybrid Ty-VLPs are good immunogens even in the absence of adjuvant. Similar approaches to the production of polyvalent particulate antigens involve using carrier proteins derived from hepatitis B and polio viruses.,1988
s66837,requirement for the simian virus 40 small tumor antigen in tumorigenesis in transgenic mice.,"requirement for the simian virus 40 small tumor antigen in tumorigenesis in transgenic mice.. To examine the role of simian virus 40 (SV40) large T and small t antigens in tumorigenesis in animals, we generated transgenic mice which expressed either both the SV40 large T and small t antigens or the SV40 large T antigen alone under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat. The mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat directs the expression of transgenes in ductal epithelial cells of several organs, including the mammary gland, lung, and kidney, and in lymphoid cells. The mice which expressed both the T and t tumor antigens developed lung and kidney adenocarcinomas, while those which expressed large T alone did not. Both types of mice developed malignant lymphomas with similar frequencies and latency periods. Our results show that the SV40 small t antigen cooperates with the large T antigen in inducing tumors in slowly dividing epithelial cells in the lung and kidney.",1988
s67135,live attenuated bacterial vaccines: new approaches for safety and efficacy.,"live attenuated bacterial vaccines: new approaches for safety and efficacy.. Problems arising from reversion to virulence in genetically attenuated bacterial vaccines can be overcome by the combination, in one strain, of multiple temperature-sensitive mutations of identical phenotype. Immunogenicity of attenuated strains may be enhanced by incorporation of mutations which permit limited replication in the vaccinee (thereby increasing antigen mass while minimising the possibility of vaccine reactions) and the expression of genes coding for antigens which are synthesised only during infection of the host.",1985
s67622,serological diagnosis of primary sjogren's syndrome by means of human recombinant la (ss-b) as nuclear antigen.,"serological diagnosis of primary sjogren's syndrome by means of human recombinant la (ss-b) as nuclear antigen.. Human recombinant La nucleoprotein was purified from cultures of Escherichia coli containing a vector with a 1.4 kilobase cDNA encoding La; the nucleoprotein was used to test for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) to La. Serum samples from 260 patients with autoimmune diseases associated with ANA and 100 healthy subjects were tested by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Samples from 47 (94%) of 50 patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome and 1 (7%) of 14 patients with secondary Sjogren's syndrome reacted with the recombinant La. No reactivity was demonstrated in 196 patients with other ANA-associated autoimmune diseases or in 100 healthy subjects. The study confirms the high correlation between ANA, anti-La, and primary Sjogren's syndrome and shows how gene cloning can provide large quantities of human autoantigens for use in highly specific and sensitive diagnostic assays.",1987
s67872,baculovirus expression of the small genome segment of hantaan virus and potential use of the expressed nucleocapsid protein as a diagnostic antigen.,"baculovirus expression of the small genome segment of hantaan virus and potential use of the expressed nucleocapsid protein as a diagnostic antigen.. Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) was used as an expression vector for the nucleocapsid protein gene of Hantaan virus. Two different cDNA clones representing the small genome segment of Hantaan virus were inserted into the transfer vector pAcYM1, and recombinants were generated by replacement of a portion of the baculovirus polyhedrin gene with the foreign, Hantaan virus gene. Recombinants containing both the first and second ATG initiation codons of the Hantaan virus gene produced nucleocapsid protein, while those containing only the second codon did not. The expressed nucleocapsid protein was evaluated as a potential diagnostic antigen with a variety of hantavirus-immune sera. The high levels of expression obtained, specific serological reactivity with immune sera and the low level of biological containment required for production of this protein all suggest a significant advantage over authentic viral antigen for diagnosis of hantavirus infection.",1988
s67957,"safe, live vibrio cholerae vaccines?","safe, live vibrio cholerae vaccines?. Mutants of Vibrio cholerae defective in intestinal colonization have been constructed. Characterization of these mutants has led to the identification of a gene cluster involved in the assembly of a pilus colonization factor called TCP. The tcp operon has been cloned and strains of V. cholerae have been constructed that overproduce this pilus and the B subunit of cholera toxin. Together these studies may contribute to the eventual construction of efficient live and killed, oral cholera vaccines.",1988

The genes encoding the A (toxic) subunit of cholera toxin were deleted from pathogenic Vibrio cholerae O1 strain 569B by recombinant techniques, leaving intact production of immunogenic, non-toxic B subunit. The resultant strain, CVD 103, evaluated for safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy as a live oral vaccine, was highly attenuated and elicited strong antibacterial and antitoxic immune responses; a single dose significantly protected volunteers against challenge with pathogenic V cholerae O1 of either serotype or biotype. A further derivative, CVD 103-HgR, which has an Hg++-resistance gene to differentiate it from wild-type vibrios, was also well-tolerated, immunogenic, and protective; moreover, faecal excretion of this derivative was significantly lower than that of CVD 103, which should minimise environmental spread of the vaccine. CVD 103-HgR is a candidate for expanded clinical trials in endemic areas.",1988
s68103,limited immunological recognition of critical malaria vaccine candidate antigens.,"limited immunological recognition of critical malaria vaccine candidate antigens.. Current vaccine development strategies for malaria depend on widespread immunological responsiveness to candidate antigens such as the zygote surface antigens and the sporozoite coat protein, the circumsporozoite (CS) protein. Since immunological responsiveness is controlled mainly by genes mapping within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), the humoral immune response to the zygote surface antigens and the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to the CS protein were examined in MHC-disparate congenic mouse strains. Only two of six strains responded to the 230-kilodalton zygote surface antigen and another two strains responded to the 48/45-kilodalton surface antigen. From two mouse strains, expressing between them five different class I MHC molecules, there was recognition of only a single CTL epitope from the CS protein, which was from a polymorphic segment of the molecule. The restricted CTL response to this protein parallels the restricted antibody response to this protein observed in humans and mice. These findings suggest that subunit malaria vaccines now being developed may be ineffective.",1988
s68118,two trans-acting regulatory genes (vir and mod) control antigenic modulation in bordetella pertussis.,"two trans-acting regulatory genes (vir and mod) control antigenic modulation in bordetella pertussis.. Expression of virulence factors by Bordetella pertussis is altered by environmental signals (antigenic modulation) and is dependent on an activator encoded by a gene called vir. We have used TnphoA (Tn5 IS50L::phoA) gene fusions to define two sets of genes whose expression is either activated (vag loci) or repressed (vrg loci) by modulation signals. Both groups of genes appear to be regulated by the vir gene product in that, in the absence of modulators, null mutations in vir lead to the repression of vag gene fusions and derepression of vrg gene fusions. Mutants of B. pertussis were isolated that constitutively express virulence factors in the presence of the modulator MgSO4, nicotinic acid, or low incubation temperature. We designate the gene that carries such mutations mod (modulation) and have characterized one (mod-1) of these mod constitutive mutations. A method was developed for the insertional inactivation of the vir gene by using the integration of a suicide replicon. Inactivation of the vir gene in the mod-1 mutant, followed by transcomplementation with the cloned wild-type vir gene, gives the Mod-1 constitutive phenotype, showing that the mod-1 mutation defines a gene distinct from vir. The gene carrying the mod-1 mutation is linked to vir and was cloned on a recombinant cosmid (pLAF-C1) which transcomplements the vir-1::Tn5 mutation in B. pertussis 347. Introduction of pLAF-C1 into vir mutant and vir+ B. pertussis strains also gives the Mod-1 constitutive phenotype, indicating that mod-1 is a dominant allele. These data suggest that the mod gene product could have sensory functions for the environmental signals that affect the expression of vir-regulated genes of B. pertussis. The mod constitutive strains and plasmids described here also have applications in pertussis vaccine development.",1988
s68242,a chromosomal integration system for stabilization of heterologous genes in salmonella based vaccine strains.,"a chromosomal integration system for stabilization of heterologous genes in salmonella based vaccine strains.. We have developed a system whereby heterologous DNA encoding an antigen from an enteropathogen may be recombined into the chromosome of an attenuated Salmonella carrier strain. The system involves two steps: (i) integration of a hisOG deletion mutation into the chromosome; (ii) replacement of the hisOG deletion by the complete hisOG region and the segment of heterologous DNA which encodes the antigen of interest. Recombinants may be selected (his+). The system was used to integrate the genes encoding K88 fimbriae from enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli into the chromosome of a galE mutant of Salmonella typhimurium (LT2H1). Recombinants were detected at a frequency of between 1.0 x 10(-3) and 1.5 x 10(-3). A variety of tests confirmed that the K88 genes were integrated into the chromosome of LT2H1 and were expressed. The stability of the recombinant was tested both in vivo and in vitro. When administered orally to mice, the recombinant elicited a serum antibody response to K88, and retained the Salmonella vaccine potential of the vector strain.",1988
s68324,sv40 large t antigen binds preferentially to an underphosphorylated member of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product family.,"sv40 large t antigen binds preferentially to an underphosphorylated member of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product family.. Extracts of monkey cells (CV-1P) synthesizing SV40 large T antigen (T) were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies to T or p110-114Rb, the product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb). While a family of p110-114Rb proteins can be detected in anti-Rb immunoprecipitates, only one member of this family, p110Rb, was found in anti-T precipitates of these extracts. Identical results were obtained with extracts of CV-1P cells which had been previously mixed in vitro with highly purified T. The p110-114Rb family is composed of two sets--p110Rb, an un- or under-phosphorylated species, and pp112-114Rb, a group of overtly phosphorylated proteins. Thus, T bound preferentially to the un- or underphosphorylated member of the family. In addition, T failed to alter the relative abundances of these species. These results suggest a model in which the growth suppression function of Rb is down modulated either by phosphorylation or T antigen binding.",1989
s68561,"a novel heteromorphic human cell surface alloantigen, gp60, defined by a human monoclonal antibody.","a novel heteromorphic human cell surface alloantigen, gp60, defined by a human monoclonal antibody.. A human mAb (DSM1) generated from a patient immunized with irradiated allogeneic melanoma cells detects a new cell surface alloantigen of restricted cell type distribution. The Ag is a 60,000-Da glycoprotein (gp60) that displays considerable heteromorphism in its cytosolic and cytoskeletal (52 to 62 kDa) and membrane forms (60 to 64 kDa). The gp60 Ag has been purified using lectin affinity, ion exchange, and Mono P fast performance liquid chromatography. Rabbit antiserum against purified gp60 recognizes a homologous gp60 molecule on DSM1-nonreactive cells. Molecular properties of gp60 and a partial amino acid sequence of a tryptic gp60-derived peptide distinguish it from other known human alloantigens. This is the first report of a human alloantigenic system whose definition required a cell type other than those of bone marrow derivation.",1989
s68568,transfected mouse melanoma lines that express various levels of human melanoma-associated antigen p97.,"transfected mouse melanoma lines that express various levels of human melanoma-associated antigen p97.. The gene for the human melanoma-associated antigen p97 has been introduced by cDNA transfection into cells from clone M2 of the K1735 mouse melanoma, which metastasizes to the lung when injected iv into syngeneic C3H/HeN mice. Tumor clones were established from the transfected cells and found to differ in the level of p97 expression. Their outgrowth in immunocompetent syngeneic mice was shown to inversely correlate with p97 antigen expression, and lines that express higher p97 levels elicited a stronger delayed-type hypersensitivity response when injected into the footpads of mice immune to p97. Five clones which expressed very high levels of p97 failed to grow in immunocompetent C3H/HeN mice while they formed tumors in nude (nu/nu) mice. The highest expressing clone, 2A, grew slightly faster than any of the other clones when cultured in vitro. Since several of the transfected clones were found to express a stable level of p97 and have consistent in vivo growth behavior, they provide a useful model for various forms of antigen-specific active and passive immunotherapy with the same agents as those intended for human application.",1989
s68662,identification of a human homologue of the murine tumor rejection antigen gp96.,"identification of a human homologue of the murine tumor rejection antigen gp96.. A family of cell surface glycoproteins with a molecular weight of 96,000 (gp96) has recently been implicated in the individually distinct immunogenicity of chemically induced sarcomas of inbred mice. Rabbit antiserum to murine gp96 detects an antigenically related Mr 96,000 cell surface glycoprotein on two cultured human melanoma cell lines, SK-MEL-13 and SK-MEL-177. Molecular probes for 5' and 3' ends of the murine gp96 gene detect a 3.5-kilobase transcript in RNA preparations from melanoma cells, similar to the murine gp96 transcript. While 5' probes do not hybridize to Southern blots of genomic human DNA, the 3' probes identify several distinct bands under stringent hybridization and washing conditions. This suggests that the 3' end of the gp96 gene is more conserved than its 5' end. No gross alterations in gp96 gene organization were detected in melanoma cells. B-lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from four different individuals also showed no restriction fragment polymorphism in the gp96 gene.",1989
s68803,multiple chemical forms of hepatitis b surface antigen produced in yeast.,"multiple chemical forms of hepatitis b surface antigen produced in yeast.. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) has been extracted from yeast cells that produce HBsAg. These cells contain the gene for surface antigen carried on a plasmid that replicates in the cells. Analysis of the yeast-derived HBsAg by sucrose gradient centrifugation and by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shows that the antigen that is initially released from yeast cells is a high molecular weight aggregate of the fundamental Mr 25,000 subunit. Unlike HBsAg derived from human plasma, the yeast antigen is held together by noncovalent interactions and can be dissociated in 2% NaDodSO4 without the use of reducing agents. During in vitro purification of the yeast antigen, some disulfide bonds form spontaneously between the antigen subunits, resulting in a particle composed of a mixture of monomers and disulfide-bonded dimers. Treatment with 3 M thiocyanate converts the 20-nm particles into a fully disulfide-bonded form that is not disrupted in NaDodSO4 unless a reducing agent is added. This disulfide-bonded particle resembles the naturally occurring, plasma-derived surface antigen particle, and the in vitro formed particle has been used to prepare a vaccine for humans against hepatitis B virus infection.",1985
s68845,properties of purified t cell subsets. i. in vitro responses to class i vs. class ii h-2 alloantigens.,"properties of purified t cell subsets. i. in vitro responses to class i vs. class ii h-2 alloantigens.. In light of the widely accepted view that Ia-restricted L3T4+ T helper cells play a decisive role in controlling the differentiation of Lyt-2+ cells, experiments were designed to examine whether Lyt-2+ cells can respond to antigen in the absence of L3T4+ cells. The results showed that highly purified Lyt-2+ cells gave high primary mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) to various class I differences, including both mutant and allelic differences; responses to class II (Ia) differences were generally undetectable with Lyt-2+ cells. The intensity of MLR to class I differences was not affected by addition of anti-L3T4 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to the cultures or by removing T cells from the stimulator populations. Negative selection experiments showed that Lyt-2+ cells could respond to class I differences across Ia barriers. MLR of purified Lyt-2+ cells peaked on days 3-4 and then fell sharply; background responses with syngeneic stimulators (auto-MLR) were virtually absent. Parallel experiments with purified L3T4+ cells showed that this subset responded in MLR only to class II (Ia) and not class I differences, reached peak responses only on day 6 rather than days 3-4, and often gave high auto-MLR. Within the first 3-4 d of culture, MLR were generally higher with Lyt-2+ cells than L3T4+ cells. Although no evidence could be found that Ia-restricted L3T4+ cells were required for the response of Lyt-2+ cells, presentation of antigen by Ia+ cells appeared to be essential. Thus, responses were ablated by pretreating stimulator cells with anti-Ia mAb plus C'. Significantly the failure of Lyt-2+ cells to respond to anti-Ia plus C'-treated stimulators could not be restored by adding syngeneic spleen cells; addition of IL-2 led to only a minor (15%) restoration of the response. It is suggested that Ia+ cells provide an obligatory second signal required by Lyt-2+ cells.",1985
s68853,impaired intracellular transport of class i mhc antigens as a possible means for adenoviruses to evade immune surveillance.,"impaired intracellular transport of class i mhc antigens as a possible means for adenoviruses to evade immune surveillance.. Early region E3 of adenovirus-2 encodes a glycoprotein, E19, that associates with class I MHC antigens. The interaction occurs concomitantly with abrogated terminal glycosylation of class I antigen heavy chains, as shown by pulse-chase and Endo H digestion experiments. Also the viral protein remains in the high mannose form throughout the chase period. These results do not reflect a general impairment of terminal glycosylation of membrane proteins. Immunofluorescence analyses demonstrated that in virally infected cells E19 and class I antigens accumulate in the perinuclear region. Class I antigens gradually disappear from the cell surface. A diminished cell surface expression of class I antigens may be a means by which adenoviruses evade immune surveillance.",1985
s68977,the role of the t3/antigen receptor complex in t-cell activation.,"the role of the t3/antigen receptor complex in t-cell activation.. The role of the T3/antigen receptor complex is summarized by the diagram presented in Figure 4. Signals transmitted through T3/Ti activate a phosphodiesterase. This enzyme acts on its substrate PIP2 to generate two important mediators, IP3 and diacylglycerol. IP3 mobilizes calcium from bound intracellular stones. This increase in [Ca2+]i is one intracellular signal which, in conjunction with others, induces expression of lymphokine genes by influencing pretranslational, presumably transcriptional, events. Several problems remain. Which of the five molecules in the T3/Ti complex serves as the effector molecule in the transmembrane signaling process is not known. Which molecules serve to link T3/Ti to the phosphodiesterase enzyme is under investigation. The role diacylglycerol protein kinase C and other mediators play in signalling activation is not established. Finally, for those events occurring after the early events pictured in Figure 4 that result in gene activation, the sequence is a black box. Approaches to address each of these questions are available, and answers should be forthcoming.",1986
s69142,recombinant human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody specific for common acute lymphocytic leukemia antigen.,"recombinant human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody specific for common acute lymphocytic leukemia antigen.. A human-mouse chimeric antibody constructed in the present study was specific for a human tumor-associated antigen, common acute lymphocytic leukemia antigen. The antibody consisted of human heavy and light chain constant domains (gamma 1 and kappa type) and mouse heavy and light chain variable domains, which were derived from human plasma cell leukemia line (ARH77) and mouse hybridoma cells (NL-1) specific for common acute lymphocytic leukemia antigen, respectively. The artificially fused immunoglobulin molecules were produced in mouse myeloma cells, X63Ag8.653 which were transformed with the chimeric heavy and light chain genes formed by joining the corresponding gene segments in vitro at the J-C introns. The human heavy chain enhancer element was ligated tot he chimeric heavy and light chain genes, and this enhancer appeared to be obligatory for the efficient production of the chimeric antibody molecules. The stably transformed cells secreted the chimeric antibody, which specifically bound a common acute lymphocytic leukemia antigen expressing cell line. The amount of the chimeric antibody produced (10-30 micrograms/ml in the serum-free medium) was comparable to that made by murine hybridoma line, NL-1. The molecular weight of the chimeric heavy chain molecules was reduced from 54,000 to 50,000 upon treatment with tunicamycin, suggesting that the peptide was normally glycosylated in the transformants. The chimeric antibody exhibited complement-dependent cytotoxicity, in which glycosylation is thought to be indispensable. The antibody also mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity to the human target cells. The antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity activity of the chimeric antibody was twice that of the murine NL-1 monoclonal antibody when human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used as effectors.",1987
s69155,isolation of lambda amp3 genomic recombinants coding for antigens of eimeria tenella.,"isolation of lambda amp3 genomic recombinants coding for antigens of eimeria tenella.. Eimeria are the causative agents of coccidosis, a disease which is of world wide economic importance in the poultry industry. Immunity resulting from infection is species-specific and both antibody and cell-mediated responses have been implicated. As an initial step in the development of a genetically-engineered vaccine against coccidiosis, libraries of EcoRI-digested genomic DNA from E. tenella have been constructed in Escherichia coli using the expression vector lambda amp3. Screening of the libraries with serum from chickens immunized by infection has identified at least 24 different recombinant phage which produce eimeria antigens fused to beta-galactosidase. A significant proportion of the Eimeria DNA inserts cross-hybridise with each other and contain sequences which are highly represented in the genome. The identification of these clones will enable the isolation of intact genes from E. tenella DNA and facilitate detailed analysis of the antigens and immune responses.",1987
s69200,cytotoxic t cell activation by class i protein on cell-size artificial membranes: antigen density and lyt-2/3 function.,"cytotoxic t cell activation by class i protein on cell-size artificial membranes: antigen density and lyt-2/3 function.. The role of antigen surface density, and its relationship to the function of the Lyt-2/3 complex, in recognition and triggering of allospecific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) precursors has been studied by using a novel type of Class I protein-bearing artificial membrane. The cell-size membranes, termed pseudocytes (artificial cells), can be handled like cells but have a well-defined and easily quantitated surface composition. Class I antigen on these membranes stimulated generation of secondary in vitro allogeneic CTL responses as effectively as allogeneic spleen cells, provided that lymphokines were added to the cultures. Antigen density on the pseudocyte surfaces could be varied over a wide range and quantitated by papain cleavage and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Recognition and triggering of precursor CTL was found to be dramatically dependent on the surface density of antigen and displayed a marked threshold density requirement, below which little or no response occurred. Examination of the effects of anti-Lyt-2 antibody on responses to pseudocytes provided direct evidence for a reciprocal relationship between antigen density and susceptibility to antibody blockade. The results strongly suggest that antigen density is likely to have important biological consequences in control of immune responses. They also show that if Lyt-2/3 functions by interaction with a ligand, then that ligand is the Class I protein.",1987
s69300,recombinant adenovirus induces antibody response to hepatitis b virus surface antigen in hamsters.,"recombinant adenovirus induces antibody response to hepatitis b virus surface antigen in hamsters.. Recombinant adenoviruses carrying the hepatitis B virus surface antigen coding sequence in the adenovirus E3 region were constructed using DNA from either adenovirus type 5 or an adenovirus type 5 E3-region deletion mutant. Both of these recombinant adenoviruses replicated as efficiently as wild-type adenovirus in all human cells tested, including the human diploid cell strain WI-38. This indicates that insertion of the hepatitis B virus surface antigen gene into the E3 region does not significantly affect viral replication. Human cells infected with these recombinant adenoviruses secreted immunoreactive hepatitis B virus surface antigen. Since a practical small animal model for human adenoviruses was lacking, a hamster model was developed to evaluate the immunogenic potential of these recombinant adenoviruses. Upon intranasal inoculation, both wild-type adenovirus and the adenovirus E3-region deletion mutant replicated in the lungs of these animals and induced an antibody response against adenovirus. Hamsters similarly immunized with the live recombinant adenoviruses produced antibody against both adenovirus and hepatitis B virus surface antigen.",1987
s69302,carcinoembryonic antigen family: expression in a mouse l-cell transfectant and characterization of a partial cdna in bacteriophage lambda gt11.,"carcinoembryonic antigen family: expression in a mouse l-cell transfectant and characterization of a partial cdna in bacteriophage lambda gt11.. Genomic DNA and mRNA from the adenocarcinoma cell line LoVo were used to generate L-cell transfectants and a bacteriophage lambda gt11 cDNA clone that express epitopes of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Primary and secondary L-cell transfectants expressing CEA were selected with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). These transfectants, including some clones that were selected for high-level CEA expression by multiple rounds of FACS sorting, express a surface protein of 150 kDa that reacts with all anti-CEA antibodies tested. In parallel, a cDNA library of LoVo poly(A)+ RNA was constructed in lambda gt11 and fusion proteins were screened with polyclonal antisera against CEA. One positive clone, lambda cLV7, was identified that hybridized specifically to transfectant DNA. The nucleic acid sequence of the cDNA insert (cLV7) contained two regions of extensive internal homology, with greater than 70% identity at the amino acid level. cLV7 hybridized to three mRNA species of LoVo cells and to a predominant mRNA of the CEA-expressing transfectants. Hybridization of cLV7 to restriction endonuclease-digested genomic DNA of colon carcinoma cells, normal human cells, and human-mouse somatic cell hybrids revealed the presence of multiple hybridizing bands, one of which was present in transfectant cells. These CEA-related sequences are not rearranged in tumors and, by somatic cell hybrid analysis, were mapped to human chromosome 19.",1987
s69363,the e3/19k protein of adenovirus type 2 binds to the domains of histocompatibility antigens required for ctl recognition.,"the e3/19k protein of adenovirus type 2 binds to the domains of histocompatibility antigens required for ctl recognition.. The E3/19K protein of human adenovirus type 2 binds to HLA class I antigens and blocks their terminal glycosylation and cell surface expression. The nature of this interaction is non-covalent and involves neither disulfide bridges between the two molecules nor their carbohydrates. The murine H-2 Kd antigen associates with the E3/19K protein in a similar fashion to human HLA antigens whereas the allelic product H-2 Kk does not. Hybrid genes between the Kd and Kk alleles were constructed and their products were expressed in embryonic kidney cells together with the E3/19K protein. This allowed us to identify the alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains as the essential structures of the histocompatibility antigens for binding the viral protein. Interestingly, these domains are also crucial for T cell recognition. The implications for the evolution of adenoviruses and their ability to cause persistent infections are discussed.",1987
s69398,hepatitis b vaccines.,"hepatitis b vaccines.. The high rate of infection with hepatitis B virus in certain defined populations in industralized countries and among the general population in many non-industrialized countries stresses the need for hepatitis B vaccines. Hepatitis B, one of at least six different forms of viral hepatitis, may progress to chronic liver disease, including chronic persistent hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis and primary liver cancer. Primary liver cancer is one of the ten most common cancers in the world today. Immunization against hepatitis B is required therefore for groups at high risk of infection according to epidemiological patterns, socioeconomic factors, cultural and sexual practices and the environment.",1986
s69499,structural model of hla-dr1 restricted t cell antigen recognition.,"structural model of hla-dr1 restricted t cell antigen recognition.. Two human helper T cell determinants in influenza have been identified, one in the hemagglutinin and the other in the matrix protein (M1). Both were shown to be DR1 restricted by using transfected L cells to present antigen. Comparison of the sequences of the two peptides revealed a similar pattern that could account for their DR1 specificity if the peptides adopt a helical conformation. The model was supported by the demonstration that hybrid peptides, composed of the amino acids that interact with DR1 from one determinant and the residues that interact with the T cell receptor from the other, were recognized by each clone. The generality of the motif was confirmed by the finding that DR1 individuals respond to a ragweed peptide containing the defined pattern.",1988
s69680,thymic major histocompatibility complex antigens and the alpha beta t-cell receptor determine the cd4/cd8 phenotype of t cells.,"thymic major histocompatibility complex antigens and the alpha beta t-cell receptor determine the cd4/cd8 phenotype of t cells.. T-cell receptors and T-cell subsets were analysed in T-cell receptor transgenic mice expressing alpha and beta T-cell receptor genes isolated from a male-specific, H-2Db-restricted CD4-8+ T-cell clone. The results indicate that the specific interaction of the T-cell receptor on immature thymocytes with thymic major histocompatibility complex antigens determines the differentiation of CD4+8+ thymocytes into either CD4+8- or CD4-8+ mature T cells.",1988
s69794,"identification of sequence changes in the cold-adapted, live attenuated influenza vaccine strain, a/ann arbor/6/60 (h2n2).","identification of sequence changes in the cold-adapted, live attenuated influenza vaccine strain, a/ann arbor/6/60 (h2n2).. Nucleotide sequences have been obtained for RNA segments encoding the PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M1, M2, NS1, and NS2 proteins of the influenza A/Ann Arbor/6/60 (H2N2) wild-type (wt) virus and its cold-adapted (ca) derivative that has been used for preparing investigational live attenuated vaccines. Twenty-four nucleotide differences between the ca and wt viruses were detected, of which 11 were deduced to code for amino acid substitutions in the ca virus proteins. One amino acid substitution each was predicted for the PB2, M2, and NS1 proteins. Two amino acid substitutions were predicted for the NP and the PA proteins. Four substitutions were predicted for the PB1 protein. The biological significance of mutations in the PB2, PB1, PA, and M2 genes of the ca virus is suggested by currently available genetic data, a comparison with other available influenza gene sequences, and the nature of the predicted amino acid changes. In addition, the sequence data confirm the close evolutionary relationship between the genomes of influenza A (H2N2) and influenza A (H3N2) viruses.",1988
s69921,antibodies to peptides detect new hepatitis b antigen: serological correlation with hepatocellular carcinoma.,"antibodies to peptides detect new hepatitis b antigen: serological correlation with hepatocellular carcinoma.. The expression of a previously unidentified gene product, encoded by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome, has been achieved with a recombinant SV40 expression vector. Antibodies against synthetic peptides representing defined regions of this protein were used to screen cells infected with recombinant virus as well as tissues naturally infected with HBV. A 24,000-dalton protein (p24) was detected in cells infected with recombinant virus and a 28,000-dalton protein (p28) was detected in tissues infected with HBV. The peptides or recombinant-derived protein were used as antigens to screen sera from individuals infected with HBV. Specific antibodies were detected predominantly in sera from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The presence of p28 in tissues infected with HBV and the appearance of specific antibodies in infectious sera establish the existence of an additional marker for HBV infection.",1985
s69979,genome differences among field isolates and vaccine strains of pseudorabies virus.,"genome differences among field isolates and vaccine strains of pseudorabies virus.. The DNA of field isolates and vaccine strains of pseudorabies virus (PRV) was analysed by digestion with the restriction endonuclease BamHI. A number of distinct restriction profiles of the field isolates obtained from different locations within Europe were observed. As for herpes simplex virus, the variations could be classified into two types: first, alterations in the mobility of fragments due to the presence of additional sequences and/or the occurrence of deletions, a phenomenon most apparent in fragments containing part or whole of the repeat sequence of PRV DNA; second, generation of differently sized fragments due to loss and/or gain of restriction endonuclease cleavage sites. By analysis of several strains with BamHI a small number of variable cleavage sites were identified within particular regions of the unique long (UL) segment of the PRV genome. Compared to wild-type PRV, the restriction fragment patterns of vaccine strains showed characteristic alterations, including the absence of bands, which were non-variable in wild-type strains, and/or the presence of new bands some of which were submolar. Some of these characteristics could be explained by a deletion in the unique short (US) region of the genome of most vaccine strains and the occurrence of closely related variants in the uncloned vaccine virus stocks.",1985

Wild-type bovine rotavirus (UK strain) was reassorted with human rotavirus strains D, DS-1, and P; wild-type rhesus rotavirus was reassorted with human rotavirus strains D and DS-1. The D, DS-1, and P strains represent human rotavirus serotypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Monospecific antiserum (to bovine rotavirus, NCDV strain) or a set of monoclonal antibodies to the major outer capsid neutralization glycoprotein, VP7 (of the rhesus rotavirus), was used to select for reassortants with human rotavirus neutralization specificity. This selection technique yielded many reassortants which received only the gene segment coding for the major neutralization protein from the human rotavirus parent, whereas the remaining genes were derived from the animal rotavirus parent. Single human rotavirus gene substitution reassortants of this sort represent potential live vaccine strains.",1985
s70089,an adenovirus vector system used to express polyoma virus tumor antigens.,"an adenovirus vector system used to express polyoma virus tumor antigens.. We have used a generalized adenovirus vector system to express the three polyoma tumor (T) antigen proteins under the control of the adenovirus major late promoter. One hybrid virus, Ad-PySVR498, expresses high levels of polyoma middle and small T antigens. A second hybrid virus, Ad-LTSVR545, which contains a cDNA copy of the polyoma A gene, overproduces large T antigen. The T antigens produced are indistinguishable from their authentic polyoma counterparts as determined by immunoprecipitation and partial cleavage by V8 protease. Analysis of polyoma mRNAs encoded by the recombinant viruses showed that they initiate from the adenovirus major late promoter and contain the tripartite leader at their 5' ends. Large T antigen isolated from Ad-LTSVR545-infected cells by immunoaffinity was shown to bind selectively to polyoma DNA sequences that contain the origin of viral DNA replication as well as the sites for transcription initiation.",1985
s70242,major glycoprotein antigens that induce antibodies in aids patients are encoded by htlv-iii.,"major glycoprotein antigens that induce antibodies in aids patients are encoded by htlv-iii.. Antibodies from the serum of patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or with the AIDS-related complex and from the serum of seropositive healthy homosexuals, recognize two major glycoproteins in cells infected with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV III). These glycoproteins, gp160 and gp120, are encoded by the 2.5-kilobase open reading frame located in the 3' end of the HTLV-III genome, as determined by amino terminus sequence analysis of the radiolabeled forms of these proteins. It is hypothesized that gp160 and gp120 represent the major species of virus-encoded envelope gene products for HTLV-III.",1985
s70243,virus envelope protein of htlv-iii represents major target antigen for antibodies in aids patients.,"virus envelope protein of htlv-iii represents major target antigen for antibodies in aids patients.. In this study, two glycoproteins (gp160 and gp120) that are encoded by human T-cell lymphoma virus type III (HTLV-III) were the antigens most consistently recognized by antibodies found in patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and with the AIDS-related complex (ARC) and in healthy homosexual males. The techniques used to detect the glycoproteins were radioimmunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (RIP/SDS-PAGE). Although most antibody-positive samples from ARC patients and from healthy homosexual males also reacted with the virus core protein p24, less than half of the AIDS patients revealed a positive band with p24 under the same conditions. The ability to detect antibodies against a profile of both the major env gene encoded antigens and the gag gene encoded antigens suggests that the RIP/SDS-PAGE may be a valuable confirmatory assay for establishing the presence or absence of antibodies to HTLV-III in human serum samples.",1985
s70609,sv40 enhancer and large-t antigen are instrumental in development of choroid plexus tumours in transgenic mice.,"sv40 enhancer and large-t antigen are instrumental in development of choroid plexus tumours in transgenic mice.. We have shown recently that choroid plexus tumours frequently develop in transgenic mice which have developed from fertilized eggs injected with DNA molecules containing both simian virus 40 (SV40) early-region genes and metallothionein (MT) fusion genes, and several lines of mice have now been established in which all of the offspring that inherit the foreign DNA succumb to these tumours at 3-5 months of age (ref. 1 and our unpublished data). Several other tissues, notably thymus and kidney, occasionally also show pathological changes. SV40 large-T antigen protein and messenger RNA are always present in affected tissues at much greater concentrations than in unaffected tissues, suggesting that SV40 early-region genes are preferentially activated in choroid plexus, thymus and kidney and that this activation frequently leads to tumorigenesis in the choroid plexus. To determine which regions of the original constructs are important for this tumorigenesis, we have now tested several derivatives and report here that the large-T antigen is sufficient, that the MT fusion gene is dispensable and that the SV40 enhancer (72-base-pair repeat region) has an important role in directing tumours to the choroid plexus. Deletion of the SV40 enhancer region alone commonly leads to peripheral neuropathy, as well as liver and pancreatic tumours, which are the subject of the accompanying paper. Evidence is presented that these pathologies may result from an enhancing effect of the MT sequences on large-T antigen genes, made possible by removal of the otherwise dominant SV40 enhancer.",1985
s70741,trans activation of the simian virus 40 late transcription unit by t-antigen.,"trans activation of the simian virus 40 late transcription unit by t-antigen.. We have investigated the role of simian virus 40 (SV40) T-antigen in the induction of late gene expression independent of its function in amplifying templates through DNA replication. Northern blot and S1 nuclease analyses showed that stimulation occurred at the transcriptional level. At least two template elements, the T-antigen-binding sites and the 72-base-pair repeats, appeared to be important for this induction. Using template mutants, we demonstrated that deletions within T-antigen-binding site II decreased T-antigen-mediated late gene expression approximately 10- to 20-fold. In addition, multiple point mutations within a single retained copy of the SV40 72-base-pair repeat decreased T-antigen-mediated late gene expression. Using in vivo competition studies, we demonstrated that competitor DNA fragments containing the SV40 control region (nucleotides 5171 through 272) quantitatively decreased SV40 late gene expression in COS-1 cells. In contrast, competition with a plasmid containing SV40 nucleotides 1 through 294 (which removes all of T-antigen-binding site I and half of site II) was much less efficient. Finally, we demonstrated that in vivo competition experiments employing competitor fragments distal to the T-antigen-binding sites within the late template region (SV40 nucleotides 180 through 2533) resulted in superinduction of late gene expression in COS-1 cells. This finding suggests that negative factors such as repressors or attenuators may modulate late SV40 gene expression before induction. Our results are consistent with a model in which induction of late gene expression involves an interaction of the SV40 origin region with DNA-binding proteins, one of which may be T-antigen. Activation of the SV40 late transcription unit may involve induction of the SV40 enhancer or removal of a repressor-like protein or both.",1985
s70861,primary structure of the precursor to the three major surface antigens of plasmodium falciparum merozoites.,"primary structure of the precursor to the three major surface antigens of plasmodium falciparum merozoites.. Recently, a class of protein antigens of high relative molecular mass (Mt) which can induce protective immunity against blood-stage malaria has been identified. In Plasmodium falciparum the protein has a Mr of approximately 195,000 (P195). It is the precursor of three proteins of Mr 83,000 (83K), 42K and 19K which are the major surface antigens of merozoites; thus it may also be useful for immunization against P. falciparum. Three studies describing the isolation of single short complementary DNA clones for part of the P195 gene sequence have been reported. Here we describe the complete structure of the P195 gene determined from further DNA clones, its organization within genomic DNA and the location of the specific processing fragments within the primary amino-acid sequence.",1985

A newly identified protein from HTLV-III/LAV, the virus implicated as the etiologic agent of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome, was studied. This protein, which has a molecular weight of 27,000 (p27), was shown by amino acid sequencing to have a coding origin 3' to the env gene on the HTLV-III genome. The presence of antibodies to p27 in virus-exposed individuals indicated that this gene is functional in the natural host.",1985

The primary structures of a cDNA and the genomic DNA of a gene selectively expressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia were determined. A computer search of the nucleotide sequence data bank identified this gene as the invariant gamma-chain associated with class II histocompatibility antigens. The invariant gamma-chain genomic sequence spans about 11 kilobases, with eight exons and seven introns. Three of the introns contain members of the Alu repeat family. A putative cap site and promoter sequence were identified at the 5' end of the gene. One or two copies of the gene is present in each haploid genome, and no evidence for amplification or polymorphism was obtained.",1985
s71272,herpes simplex virus expressing epstein-barr virus nuclear antigen 1.,"herpes simplex virus expressing epstein-barr virus nuclear antigen 1.. DNA fragments containing an open reading frame known to encode most or all of the EBNA1 protein of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were fused in the proper transcriptional orientation to the promoter regulatory domain, capping site, and a portion of the 5' transcribed noncoding sequences of the HSV-1 alpha 4 gene of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). In these constructs 20, 130, or 385 bp of EBV DNA and 28 bp of HSV-1 DNA separated the alpha 4 cap site from a putative initiator codon of the EBNA1 gene. The chimeric alpha 4-EBNA1 genes were introduced into L cells or recombined into the viral genome using the thymidine kinase selection system. The three chimeric gene constructs resident in the L cell clones expressed a protein indistinguishable from authentic EBNA1 with respect to electrophoretic and immunologic properties indicating that the ATG at the beginning of the EBV open reading frame initiated translation of the bonafide EBNA1 protein. The chimeric alpha 4-EBNA1 genes resident in L cells were induced by HSV-1 infection and were regulated as alpha genes. The chimeric alpha 4-EBNA1 gene recombined into the viral genome was also regulated as an alpha gene. The recombinant viruses were stable and expressed 50- to 100-fold more EBNA1 than is ordinarily expressed in human lymphocytes carrying the EBV genome. EBNA1 did not alter the program of HSV-1 protein expression. The utility of the vector is discussed.",1986
s71404,expression in escherichia coli of cdna fragments encoding the gene for the host-protective antigen of infectious bursal disease virus.,"expression in escherichia coli of cdna fragments encoding the gene for the host-protective antigen of infectious bursal disease virus.. The larger segment of the IBDV genome codes for a 32-kDa host-protective antigen. Inserts from a cDNA library in pBR 322, containing overlapping cDNA fragments of varying sizes and covering the entire large segment of the IBDV genome, were subcloned into a mixture of expression vectors pUR 290, 291, and 292. Clones expressing the host-protective antigen, or parts of it, were identified by an immunoblot assay and the fusion proteins were further characterized by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody specific for the 32-kDa polypeptide. Hybridization of inserts from expressing clones to the original cDNA library led to the identification of the region of the IBDV genome that codes for the 32-kDa host-protective antigen. Clone D1 which encodes approximately 50% and clone D6 which encodes the entire 32-kDa protein were selected for further studies. The fusion proteins from clones D1 and D6 were affinity purified and tested for their immunogenicity in chickens. Both fusion proteins induced the synthesis of antibodies in both primed and unprimed chickens that reacted specifically with denatured 32-kDa viral protein, but less well with intact virus. It was concluded that the response to the fusion proteins was to linear rather than conformational epitopes on the 32-kDa viral protein.",1986

The Epstein-Barr virus membrane antigen gene gp340 was isolated, inserted into several strains of vaccinia virus and expressed under the control of a vaccinia virus promoter. The EBV-derived protein which was produced by the recombinant vaccinia viruses was heavily glycosylated, readily labelled with threonine, could be detected at the surface of infected cells and had a mol. wt. of approximately 340 kd, all of which are properties of the authentic gp340. Polyclonal rabbit antisera against gp340 and an EBV-neutralising anti-gp340 monoclonal antibody both recognised cells infected with the recombinant vaccinia viruses. Moreover, rabbits vaccinated with one of the recombinants produced antibodies that recognised EBV-containing lymphoblastoid cells and neutralised EBV.",1985

The gene for the precursor of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface antigens has been cloned. The entire sequence of the gene from a Thai isolate of the parasite is reported. It provides evidence for a signal peptide, a region containing short repeating peptides and an anchor sequence. In addition, the 5' end of a Papua New Guinea isolate has been sequenced. Comparison of these and other sequences defines, at the genetic level, a polymorphic region in the protein, and suggests that other parts of the protein are less susceptible to variation. Furthermore it appears that several signal peptides of P. falciparum exhibit extensive sequence homologies.",1985

We have developed an adenovirus vector to express foreign proteins under the control of the adenovirus E1a promoter. Two recombinant plasmids, harbouring either the S gene or the pre-S2 region and the S gene of hepatitis B virus under the control of the E1a promoter, were used to construct two recombinant adenoviruses. These two viruses direct the synthesis of hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) particles during the time course of an infectious cycle. When the pre-S2 region is present in the constructed virus, the synthesis of particles carrying the receptor for polymerized human serum albumin (pHSA) is observed. Moreover, the inoculation of rabbits with this latter purified recombinant adenovirus elicits the production of antibodies that react with both HBsAg and pHSA receptor.",1985

We have expressed the coding sequence of the core gene with or without the precore region by using a simian virus 40-derived vector in heterologous mammalian cells. The results show that the precore region is not required for the expression either of core antigen (cAg) or of a related hepatitis B virus antigen, the e antigen (eAg). However, the precore region causes the cAg to become associated with cytoplasmic membranes, probably the endoplasmic reticulum. Further, the presence of the precore sequence results in the secretion of eAg. Our results suggest that the precore region plays a role in targeting core proteins to the membrane; this may be the direct cause of eAg secretion and also may aid in the interaction of the core and surface antigens in the formation of the viral particle.",1986
s71592,differential antibody responses of individuals infected with aids-associated retroviruses surveyed using the viral core antigen p25gag expressed in bacteria.,"differential antibody responses of individuals infected with aids-associated retroviruses surveyed using the viral core antigen p25gag expressed in bacteria.. Infection with the retrovirus that is the etiological agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is characterized by the development of antiviral antibodies. To generate reagents for studying immune responses to individual viral proteins, we have produced viral antigens in microorganisms by recombinant DNA techniques. Large amounts of the major core protein (p25gag) of an isolate of the AIDS retrovirus (AIDS-associated retrovirus; ARV-2) have been directly expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant p25gag (R-p25gag) has been purified and used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for antibodies to p25gag. Serum samples obtained from 100 individuals with AIDS, AIDS-related complex (ARC), or potential exposure to the virus through sexual contact with AIDS or ARC patients (contacts) were tested first in an ELISA with disrupted whole virus to determine which of the subjects had mounted an antibody response to the virus (virus seropositive) and then in the p25gag ELISA to determine if they had antibodies to this particular viral antigen. We observed a decrease in the proportion of virus seropositive individuals with antibodies to p25gag among patients groups in which the disease was more advanced; contacts were often positive (71%), ARC patients less frequently positive (48%), and AIDS patients only rarely positive (16%). Our results suggest that monitoring p25gag seropositivity of infected individuals may be useful for predicting either the prognosis or the stage of the disease.",1986
s71704,an infectious cdna clone of the poliovirus sabin strain could be used as a stable repository and inoculum for the oral polio live vaccine.,"an infectious cdna clone of the poliovirus sabin strain could be used as a stable repository and inoculum for the oral polio live vaccine.. Viruses were recovered from HeLa S3 cells and African green monkey kidney (AGMK) cells transfected with an infectious cDNA clone of poliovirus vaccine Sabin 1 strain. The viruses recovered from the different DNA-transfected cells were tested for the biological characteristics of temperature sensitivity (rct marker), plaque size, and bicarbonate concentration dependency (d marker). The results revealed that the above properties were similar to those obtained from tests on the Sabin 1 vaccine reference strain. The recovered viruses and the vaccine reference virus were passaged in AGMK cells at an elevated temperature of 37.5 degrees, and the passaged isolates were tested for the rct marker. The virus recovered from AGMK cells had the most stable rct phenotype while the virus from HeLa S3 cells had a similar stability to that of the reference virus, suggesting that the virus from AGMK cells would be more suitable as a vaccine strain than the other two viruses. Furthermore, an infectious cDNA clone of high specific infectivity, constructed by introducing SV40 large T antigen into the plasmid, was used for production of high titers of virus after transfection. The results of in vitro biological tests on the recovered virus suggested that virus produced in the transfected AGMK cells also had the high quality that is desirable in vaccine stocks. Monkey neurovirulence tests performed with these recovered viruses revealed that the recovered viruses were weakly neurovirulent, similar to the vaccine reference virus. The infectious cDNA clone of the poliovirus vaccine strain could therefore be used to generate a possible inoculum of the oral polio live vaccine. Our findings strongly suggest that an infectious cDNA clone of poliovirus RNA may be used to preserve the constancy and quality of the present seed viruses of the Sabin 1 vaccine strain.",1986
s71738,expression of polyoma virus middle-t antigen in saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"expression of polyoma virus middle-t antigen in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. The polyoma middle-T gene, lacking its intron, was inserted into a yeast expression plasmid containing the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter. Such plasmids transformed yeast at low frequency and these transformants expressed middle-T antigen at a level of approximately 0.1% cell protein. Furthermore, expression of this protein was frequently lost during growth in liquid culture and this loss of middle-T was accompanied by a twofold increase in the rate of growth. The spontaneous production of a truncated middle-T antigen, lacking the C terminus, was also observed; the expression of this protein did not inhibit the growth rate of the cells. Recovery and analysis of the expression plasmids encoding the truncated molecule showed that a single C X G base pair had been deleted from a run of nine consecutive C X G base pairs (Pyr nucleotide 1239--1247) within the middle-T coding region. This frame-shift mutation results in premature termination of the protein and loss of the strongly hydrophobic region of the molecule believed to be responsible for the membrane association of middle-T antigen.",1986
s72478,structural and functional dissection of an mhc class i antigen-binding adenovirus glycoprotein.,"structural and functional dissection of an mhc class i antigen-binding adenovirus glycoprotein.. The early transmembrane glycoprotein E19 of adenovirus-2 binds to class I antigens of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The association is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum of infected cells and abrogates the intracellular transport of the class I molecules. To examine which parts of the E19 molecule are responsible for the association with the class I antigens and which parts confine the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum we have constructed a series of mutated E19 genes, which have been expressed in an improved mammalian expression vector. By various manipulations the membrane anchoring and the cytoplasmic domains were removed from the protein. The biosynthesis of the mutant protein was examined. All mutant proteins were secreted from the cells suggesting that the transmembrane and/or cytoplasmic portions of the E19 molecule are responsible for its confinement to the endoplasmic reticulum. The ability to associate with class I antigens was retained by the lumenal domain of the E19 protein.",1986
s72584,cloning and expression of the bacillus anthracis protective antigen gene in bacillus subtilis.,"cloning and expression of the bacillus anthracis protective antigen gene in bacillus subtilis.. The gene encoding the protective antigen (PA) moiety of the tripartite exotoxin of Bacillus anthracis was cloned from the recombinant plasmid pSE36 into Bacillus subtilis 1S53 by using the plasmid vector pUB110. Two clones, designated PA1 and PA2, were identified which produced PA in liquid cultures at levels of 20.5 to 41.9 micrograms/ml. This PA was identical to B. anthracis Sterne PA with respect to migration on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and to Western blot antigenic reactivity. Addition of lethal factor or edema factor to PA1 and PA2 supernatants generated biologically active anthrax lethal toxin or edema-producing toxin, respectively. The recombinant plasmid in PA1 (pPA101) was 7.8 kilobases, whereas the PA2 strain plasmid (pPA102) was 6.1 kilobases. Both plasmids had deletions extending into the insert sequence but not into the DNA encoding the PA protein. Immunization with the live recombinant strains protected guinea pigs from lethal challenge with virulent B. anthracis spores, and the immunization partially or completely protected rats from intravenous challenge with anthrax lethal toxin.",1986
s72819,recombinant retroviruses encoding simian virus 40 large t antigen and polyomavirus large and middle t antigens.,"recombinant retroviruses encoding simian virus 40 large t antigen and polyomavirus large and middle t antigens.. We used a murine retrovirus shuttle vector system to construct recombinants capable of constitutively expressing the simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen and the polyomavirus large and middle T antigens as well as resistance to G418. Subsequently, these recombinants were used to generate cell lines that produced defective helper-free retroviruses carrying each of the viral oncogenes. These recombinant retroviruses were used to analyze the role of the viral genes in transformation of rat F111 cells. Expression of the polyomavirus middle T antigen alone resulted in cell lines that were highly tumorigenic, whereas expression of the polyomavirus large T resulted in cell lines that were highly tumorigenic, whereas expression of the polyomavirus large T resulted in cell lines that were unaltered by the criteria of morphology, anchorage-independent growth, and tumorigenicity. More surprisingly, SV40 large T-expressing cell lines were not tumorigenic despite the fact that they contained elevated levels of cellular p53 and had a high plating efficiency in soft agar. These results suggest that the SV40 large T antigen is not an acute transforming gene like the polyomavirus middle T antigen but is similar to the establishment genes such as myc and adenovirus EIa.",1986
s73028,chimeric antibody with human constant regions and mouse variable regions directed against carcinoma-associated antigen 17-1a.,"chimeric antibody with human constant regions and mouse variable regions directed against carcinoma-associated antigen 17-1a.. We have cloned the genomic DNA fragments encoding the heavy and light chain variable regions of monoclonal antibody 17-1A, and we have inserted them into mammalian expression vectors containing genomic DNA segments encoding human gamma 3 and kappa constant regions. The transfer of these expression vectors containing mouse-human chimeric immunoglobulin genes into Sp2/0 mouse myeloma cells resulted in the production of functional IgG that retained the specific binding to the surface antigen 17-1A expressed on colorectal carcinoma cells.",1987
s73193,synthesis in yeast of hepatitis b virus surface antigen modified p31 particles by gene modification.,"synthesis in yeast of hepatitis b virus surface antigen modified p31 particles by gene modification.. The pre-S2 portion of hepatitis B virus surface antigen P31 gene was modified to make gene products resistant to trypsin-like proteases in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The coding sequence for 6 amino acids (Ser44 - Thr49) including Arg48 was removed, and the altered gene was inserted into an expression vector. The modified HBsAg P31 (M-P31c) gene products, consisting of GP37 and GP34, formed particles having both HBsAg antigenicity and polymerized-albumin receptor activity. Since the M-P31c particles can elicite two kinds of protective antibodies against hepatitis B virus, anti-S and anti-pre-S2 antibodies, the M-P31c particles are expected to be potentially effective to S-nonresponders.",1986
s73225,the 65-kilodalton antigen of mycobacterium tuberculosis.,"the 65-kilodalton antigen of mycobacterium tuberculosis.. The immune response of the host to the antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis plays the key role in determining immunity from infection with as well as the pathogenicity of this organism. A 65-kilodalton (kDa) protein has been identified as one of the medically important antigens of M. tuberculosis. The gene encoding this antigen was isolated from a lambda gt11-M. tuberculosis recombinant DNA library using monoclonal antibodies directed against the 65-kDa antigen as the specific probes. The nucleotide sequence of this gene was determined, and a 540-amino-acid sequence was deduced. This sequence was shown to correspond to that of the 65-kDa antigen by constructing a plasmid in which this open reading frame was fused to the lacZ gene. The resulting fusion protein reacted specifically with the anti-65-kDa protein antibodies. A second long open reading frame was found downstream of the 65-kDa antigen gene which could encode a protein of 517 amino acids. This putative protein contained 29 tandemly arranged partial or complete matches to a pentapeptide sequence.",1987
s73263,construction and characterization of deletion mutants of pseudorabies virus: a new generation of 'live' vaccines.,"construction and characterization of deletion mutants of pseudorabies virus: a new generation of 'live' vaccines.. Various deletions were introduced into a cloned subgenomic fragment (BamHI-7), located in the unique short (US) region of the DNA from the virulent Northern Ireland Aujeszky-3 (NIA-3) strain of pseudorabies virus (PRV). In the cloned HindIII-B fragment, the MluI-BglII fragment was replaced by different MluI-BglII fragments of the deleted BamHI-7 clones. Transfection of the deleted HindIII-B fragments together with the HindIII-A fragment of either the NIA-3 or the non-virulent NIA-4 strain yielded replication-competent deletion mutants. The region in US in which sequences were deleted specified several mRNAs. Some of the mRNAs present in cells infected with NIA-3 were absent from cells infected with the deletion mutants, whereas other differently sized mRNAs were generated. The mutants were examined with respect to their biological properties in cell culture, mice and pigs. The results showed that the type of cytopathic effect induced in cell culture seemed to be determined by the UL region, using the mean time to death in mice as a parameter, markers for virulence were present in the US and UL regions and the introduction of deletions in US strongly reduced the virulence of PRV for pigs. Despite the impaired capacity of the deletion mutants to induce high titres of neutralizing antibodies in the serum, inoculation with mutants derived from NIA-3 prevented clinical disease in pigs upon challenge with the virulent parent strain. These deletion mutants provide a good basis for the production of bioengineered live PRV vaccines.",1987
s73458,identification of a peptide binding protein that plays a role in antigen presentation.,"identification of a peptide binding protein that plays a role in antigen presentation.. The helper T-cell response to globular proteins appears, in general, to require intracellular processing of the antigen, such that a peptide fragment containing the T-cell antigenic determinant is released and transported to and held on the surface of an Ia-expressing, antigen-presenting cell. However, the molecular details underlying these phenomena are largely unknown. The means by which antigenic peptides are anchored on the antigen-presenting cell surface was investigated. A cell surface protein is identified that was isolated by its ability to bind to a 24-amino acid peptide fragment of pigeon cytochrome c, residues 81-104, containing the major antigenic determinant for B10.A mouse T cells. This peptide binding protein, purified from [35S]methionine-labeled cells, appears as two discrete bands of approximately equal to 72 and 74 kDa after NaDodSO4/PAGE. The protein can be eluted from the peptide affinity column with equivalent concentrations of either the antigenic pigeon cytochrome c peptide or the corresponding nonantigenic peptide of mouse cytochrome c. However, it does not bind to the native cytochromes c, either of pigeon or mouse, and thus the protein appears to recognize some structure available only in the free peptides. This protein plays a role in antigen presentation as evidenced by the ability of rabbit antibodies raised against it to block the activation of an antigen-specific T-cell hybrid by antigen-presenting cells and pigeon cytochrome c. Its expression is not major histocompatibility complex-restricted in that the blocking activity of the antisera can be absorbed on spleen cells from mice of different haplotypes. This peptide binding protein can be isolated from a variety of cell types, including B cells, T cells, and fibroblasts. The anchoring of processed peptides on the cell surface by such a protein may play a role in antigen presentation--facilitating the interaction of antigenic peptides with Ia and/or the T-cell receptor.",1987
s73465,expression of human class ii major histocompatibility complex antigens using retrovirus vectors.,"expression of human class ii major histocompatibility complex antigens using retrovirus vectors.. Retrovirus vectors [direct orientation (DO) vectors] that permit the simultaneous expression of an inserted protein-coding sequence and a dominant-acting selectable marker have been constructed. In these vectors, an internal simian virus 40 or human metallothionein promoter sequence serves to drive the expression of the bacterial neomycin phosphotransferase or guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase genes, whereas the viral long terminal repeat sequences are utilized to promote expression of inserted sequences. In some of the vectors, the viral 5' splice site, normally used in the biogenesis of the subgenomic env-encoding mRNA, has been eliminated. These vectors yield high transient and stable titers of virus after transfection of viral packaging cell lines, show little or no depression of virus titer with a variety of inserts, and faithfully transmit recombinant proviral sequences to recipient cells. To characterize the expression potential of these vectors, a variety of inserts encoding the alpha and beta subunits of the human major histocompatibility complex class II antigen HLA-DR have been introduced into these vectors. NIH 3T3 cells infected by viruses containing HLA-DR alpha or beta cDNAs express these proteins as shown by immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled extracts. In addition, through the sequential infection of cells with retrovirus constructions expressing two different selectable markers, both subunits of the class II antigen have been introduced into NIH 3T3 cells. Such infected cells express HLA-DR molecules at the cell surface.",1987
s73468,cell-surface antigens of melanoma recognized by human monoclonal antibodies.,"cell-surface antigens of melanoma recognized by human monoclonal antibodies.. Human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were derived from lymph node lymphocytes and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from patients with melanoma. Four methods for generating human mAbs were compared: fusion with human [LICR-LON-HMy-2 (LICR-2)] or mouse (NS-1) cells; transformation by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV); and EBV transformation followed by NS-1 fusion. NS-1 fusion with lymph node lymphocytes resulted in a higher number of growing hybrids than LICR-2 fusion. Virtually no hybrids were obtained from NS-1 or LICR-2 fusions with PBL. EBV transformed lymphocytes from lymph node and peripheral blood with equal efficiency, and the yield of proliferating cultures for antibody screening was more than 10- to 30-fold greater than that obtained by fusion techniques. However, once antibody-producing cultures had been identified, stability and clonability of EBV-transformed cells were poorer than that of NS-1 hybrid cells. To combine the strengths of both methods, cultures of EBV-transformed cells were fused with NS-1; and hybrid clones were isolated that showed vigorous growth, clonability, and stable antibody secretion. Detailed specificity analysis of the mAbs produced by six of these clones indicated detection of a class 1 (unique) melanoma antigen, a class 3 melanoma antigen, and four ganglioside antigens (GD3, GM3, and two other, as yet uncharacterized, heterophile antigens).",1987
s73545,synthesis and immunogenicity of the rotavirus major capsid antigen using a baculovirus expression system.,"synthesis and immunogenicity of the rotavirus major capsid antigen using a baculovirus expression system.. Rotaviruses are the major pathogens that cause life-threatening diarrhea in young children and animals. We inserted a simian rotavirus SA11 gene 6 cDNA into the genome of the baculovirus Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus adjacent to the strong polyhedrin promoter. The major capsid antigen (VP6) was expressed in high yields (20 to 150 micrograms/10(6) cells) when Spodoptera frugiperda cells were infected with baculovirus recombinants containing SA11 gene 6 inserts. Reactivity with monospecific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies suggested that VP6, expressed intracellularly or found in the media, maintained native antigenic determinants. VP6 purified from the media from infected cells also possessed a native oligomeric structure, was immunogenic in guinea pigs, and was able to spontaneously assemble into morphologic subunits. Antisera from immunized guinea pigs failed to neutralize virus in plaque reduction assays, but detected homologous and heterologous rotavirus strains when tested by immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.",1987
s73557,expression of polyomavirus large t antigen by using a baculovirus vector.,"expression of polyomavirus large t antigen by using a baculovirus vector.. A gene encoding the large T antigen of polyomavirus was inserted into the baculovirus Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus so that gene expression was under the control of the strong, very late polyhedrin gene promoter. Significantly more large T antigen was produced in recombinant virus-infected insect cells than was observed in polyomavirus-transformed mouse cells. The insect-derived T antigen exhibited polyomavirus origin-specific DNA binding. The baculovirus expression system provides a convenient source of T antigen for in vitro studies.",1987
s73601,molecular cloning of a gene belonging to the carcinoembryonic antigen gene family and discussion of a domain model.,"molecular cloning of a gene belonging to the carcinoembryonic antigen gene family and discussion of a domain model.. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a glycoprotein important as a tumor marker for colonic cancer. Immunological and biochemical studies have shown it to be closely related to a number of other glycoproteins, which together make up a gene family. We have cloned a member of this gene family by using long oligonucleotide probes (42-54 nucleotides) based on our protein sequence data for CEA and NCA (nonspecific cross-reacting antigen) and on human codon usage. The clone obtained (lambda 39.2) hybridizes with six probes and has a 15-kilobase insert. The 5' end of the gene is contained within a 2700-base-pair EcoRI fragment, which hybridizes with five of the six synthetic probes. Sequencing of the 5' end region revealed the location and structure of one exon and two putative intron boundaries. The exon encodes part of the leader sequence and the NH2-terminal 107 amino acids of NCA. Southern blot analysis of human normal and tumor DNA, using as probes two lambda 39.2 fragments that contain coding sequences, suggests the existence of 9-11 genes for the CEA family. One of the restriction fragments described here has been used by Zimmermann et al. [Zimmermann, W., Ortlieb, B., Friedrich, R. & von Kleist, S. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84, 2960-2964] to isolate partial cDNA clones for CEA. The identity of this clone was verified with our protein sequence data [Paxton, R., Mooser, G., Pande, H., Lee, T.D. & Shively, J.E. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84, 920-924]. We discuss a domain structure for CEA based on the CEA sequence data and the NCA exon sequence data. It is likely that this gene family evolved from a common ancestor shared with neural cell adhesion molecule and alpha 1 B-glycoprotein and is perhaps a family within the immunoglobulin superfamily.",1987
s73743,second-generation pseudorabies virus vaccine with deletions in thymidine kinase and glycoprotein genes.,"second-generation pseudorabies virus vaccine with deletions in thymidine kinase and glycoprotein genes.. A modified-live pseudorabies virus (PRV) vaccine, designated PRV(dlg92/d1tk), with deletions in the thymidine kinase (tk) and glycoprotein-gIII (g92) genes, was derived from the PRV (Bucharest [BUK]-d13) vaccine strain. The vaccine virus also contained a deletion in glycoprotein gI. Despite 3 deletions, PRV(dlg92/d1tk) replicated to high titers in cell culture from 30 C to 39.1 C. Enzyme assays and autoradiography revealed that PRV(dlg92/d1tk) did not induce a functional tk activity in infected tk- RAB(BU) cells (rabbit skin). Rabbit skin cells were infected with PRV(dlg92/d1tk), with vaccine strains derived from BUK or Bartha K strains of PRV or with the virulent Illinois (ILL), Indiana-Funkhauser (IND-F), and Aujeszky (Auj) strains of PRV and were labeled with [3H]mannose from 4 or 5 to 24 hours after infection to investigate whether these viruses induced the synthesis of glycoprotein gIII. Nonionic detergent extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitated with antisera from pigs vaccinated with tk(-)-PRV(BUK-d13) or tk+-Bartha K, pigs vaccinated with tk+-PRV(BUK) strains and then challenge exposed to tk+-PRV(IND-F), naturally infected domestic or feral pigs, and pigs vaccinated with tk-)-PRV(dlg92/d1tk). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against PRV glycoproteins gIII, gp50, and gII were also studied. After immunoprecipitation, labeled PRV-specific proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The PRV glycoprotein-gII complex, but not glycoprotein gIII, was synthesized in PRV(dlg92/d1tk)-infected cells. Glycoprotein gII and gIII were made in cells infected with PRV vaccine strains BUK, Bartha K, and BUK-d13 and with virulent PRV strains ILL, IND-F, and Auj. Cells infected with PRV(dlg92/d1tk) and with PRV strains ILL, IND-F, Auj, Bartha K, BUK, and BUK-d13, excreted into the cell culture medium a highly sulfated glycoprotein gX of about 90 kilodaltons. Antibodies to glycoprotein gIII were not detected in the sera of pigs inoculated with PRV(dlg92/d1tk), but were found in all other swine sera.",1987
s73818,construction of defined gale mutants of salmonella for use as vaccines.,"construction of defined gale mutants of salmonella for use as vaccines.. We describe the molecular cloning of the gal operon of Salmonella typhimurium LT2 and the localization of the gal promoter and the genes galE, galT, and galK. The order of the genes and the direction of transcription was the same as in Escherichia coli K12. A restriction enzyme map of the operon was obtained, and the approximate termini of the gal genes were located by using transposon insertion mutagenesis and minicell analysis. We constructed a plasmid that contained a defined 0.4-kilobase deletion in the galE but still expressed galT and galK activities from the gal promoter. This galE deletion was recombined into the chromosomal gal operons of S. typhimurium and Salmonella typhi Ty2. The resulting strains were vigorous, nonreverting galE mutants that were sensitive to galactose-induced lysis at 0.2 mM galactose. The S. typhimurium galE derivatives were avirulent and protective in mice.",1987
s73833,identification of the gene encoding marek's disease herpesvirus a antigen.,"identification of the gene encoding marek's disease herpesvirus a antigen.. The gene encoding the glycoprotein Marek's disease herpesvirus A antigen (MDHV-A) precursor polypeptide pr47 was delineated by using Northern blot (RNA blot) analysis and hybrid selection of its mRNA with cloned MDHV DNA, cell-free translation of the mRNA, and immunoprecipitation of the polypeptide. The resulting piece of DNA with strongly positive hybrid selection results was a 2.2-kilobase-pair (kbp) PvuII-EcoRI restriction fragment localized to the center of the 18.3-kbp MDHV BamHI B fragment of the total virus genome. The localization was specific since no other small restriction subfragment of the larger BamHI B fragment was able to hybrid select significant MDHV-A mRNA and the gene mapped only in the BamHI B fragment of the total virus genome. Northern blot analysis confirmed the localization of the MDHV-A gene on the 2.2-kbp fragment and detected its mRNA as a 1.8-kilobase species, a size consistent with encoding a 47-kilodalton polypeptide. This is the first report of an MDHV gene being mapped to the MDHV viral genome. This opens the way for the use of recombinant DNA technology to study the nature of the gene encoding a secreted virus-specific glycoprotein that could possibly be involved in immunoprevention, immunosuppression, or immunoevasion, immune phenomena known or speculated to be involved in this oncogenic herpesvirus system.",1987
s73933,primary structure of the gene for the murine ia antigen-associated invariant chains (ii). an alternatively spliced exon encodes a cysteine-rich domain highly homologous to a repetitive sequence of thyroglobulin.,"primary structure of the gene for the murine ia antigen-associated invariant chains (ii). an alternatively spliced exon encodes a cysteine-rich domain highly homologous to a repetitive sequence of thyroglobulin.. The gene for murine Ia-associated invariant (Ii) chains (Ii31 and Ii41) was characterized by sequence analysis. The gene extends over approximately 9 kb and is organized in nine exons. Exon 1 encodes the 5' untranslated region and the cytoplasmic segment, exon 2 the membrane spanning segment and adjacent amino acids and exons 3-8 the extracytoplasmic portion of Ii31. Putative promoter sequences were found upstream of the start of the coding sequence. Between exons 6 and 7 an additional, alternatively spliced exon 6b has been identified. This exon is spliced into the mRNA coding for the Ii-related Ii41 protein. Exon 6b encodes a cysteine-rich domain of 64 amino acids. It shows a remarkably high homology to the repetitive elements in thyroglobulin, a precursor for thyroid hormone. Based on this homology, it is suggested that this domain (TgR) in Tg and in Ii41 may play a role either in hormone formation or as a carrier in the transport of molecules (thyroid hormone or processed antigen respectively) between intracellular compartments.",1987
s74095,biochemical characterization and biosynthesis of the ki-1 antigen in hodgkin-derived and virus-transformed human b and t lymphoid cell lines.,"biochemical characterization and biosynthesis of the ki-1 antigen in hodgkin-derived and virus-transformed human b and t lymphoid cell lines.. The Hodgkin-associated Ki-1 antigen was analyzed in different cell lines. In Hodgkin analogous L428 cells, biosynthetically labeled with radioactive amino acids, the Ki-1 antibody precipitated three glycoproteins with 90, 105, and 120 kDa, respectively. Surface-labeling revealed that the two larger components were membrane-associated forms of the Ki-1 antigen, although the 90-kDa molecule was shown in pulse-chase experiments to be the precursor of the 105- and 120-kDa forms. All three forms of the Ki-1 antigen possess a tunicamycin-sensitive 6-kDa N-linked carbohydrate moiety. O-Linked oligosaccharides could not be detected. Thus, the differences in m.w. are probably not due to glycosylation. The ionophore monensin prevented the appearance of the membrane-associated molecules, which demonstrated that they are assembled between the transcompartment of the Golgi complex and their insertion into the cell membrane. The 90-kDa precursor molecule cannot be generated by disulfide reduction from the two larger forms. After internal labeling with P-32, only the 105- and 120-kDa bands became visible, indicating that the Ki-1 molecule is phosphorylated after its processing into the two larger membrane-associated forms. Analysis of the Ki-1 antigens from other cell lines demonstrated that after external labeling of two other Hodgkin-derived cell lines, six Epstein-Barr virus lymphoblastoid cell lines and one human T leukemia virus I-positive T cell line, both the 105- and the 120-kDa membrane molecules could be detected, regardless of the presence or type of virus integrated.",1987
s74116,cd8-positive t lymphocytes specific for murine cytomegalovirus immediate-early antigens mediate protective immunity.,"cd8-positive t lymphocytes specific for murine cytomegalovirus immediate-early antigens mediate protective immunity.. We have shown in a murine model system for acute, lethal cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease in the immunocompromised natural host that control of virus multiplication in tissues, protection from virus-caused tissue destruction, and survival are mediated by virus-specific CD8+ CD4-T lymphocytes. Protection from a lethal course of disease did not result in a rapid establishment of virus latency, but led to a long-lasting, persistent state of infection. The CD8- CD4+ subset of T lymphocytes was not effective by itself in controlling murine CMV (MCMV) multiplication in tissue or essential for the protective function of the CD8+ CD4- effector cells. The antiviral efficacy of the purified CD8+ CD4- subset was not impaired by preincubation with fibroblasts that presented viral structural antigens, but was significantly reduced after depletion of effector cells specific for the nonstructural immediate-early antigens of MCMV, which are specified by the first among a multitude of viral genes expressed during MCMV replication in permissive cells. Thus, MCMV disease provides the first example of a role for nonstructural herpesvirus immediate-early antigens in protective immunity.",1987
s74202,t-cell antigen receptor genes and t-cell recognition.,"t-cell antigen receptor genes and t-cell recognition.. The four distinct T-cell antigen receptor polypeptides (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) form two different heterodimers (alpha:beta and gamma:delta) that are very similar to immunoglobulins in primary sequence, gene organization and modes of rearrangement. Whereas antibodies have both soluble and membrane forms that can bind to antigens alone, T-cell receptors exist only on cell surfaces and recognize antigen fragments only when they are embedded in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Patterns of diversity in T-cell receptor genes together with structural features of immunoglobulin and MHC molecules suggest a model for how this recognition might occur. This view of T-cell recognition has implications for how the receptors might be selected in the thymus and how they (and immunoglobulins) may have arisen during evolution.",1988
s74358,protection against virulent h5 avian influenza virus infection in chickens by an inactivated vaccine produced with recombinant vaccinia virus.,"protection against virulent h5 avian influenza virus infection in chickens by an inactivated vaccine produced with recombinant vaccinia virus.. A cloned cDNA copy of the haemagglutinin (HA) gene of A/Chicken/Scotland/59 (H5N1) influenza virus has been expressed in vaccinia virus. This pox virus is poorly infectious or non-infectious for chickens. However, immunization of chickens with lysates of cell cultures infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus, that had been emulsified with adjuvant and which contained an estimated 0.5 microgram influenza HA, elicited a substantial neutralizing antibody response to influenza virus. Challenges of immunized and non-immunized adult chickens with virulent A/Chicken/Scotland/59 influenza virus showed that the immunized animals were highly protected while the non-immunized controls died. Immunized birds were also protected against infection with the recent virulent H5 avian influenza virus, A/Chicken/Pennsylvania/83 (H5N2).",1988
s74402,plasmodium falciparum: gene structure and hydropathy profile of the major merozoite surface antigen (gp195) of the uganda-palo alto isolate.,"plasmodium falciparum: gene structure and hydropathy profile of the major merozoite surface antigen (gp195) of the uganda-palo alto isolate.. The gene encoding the 195,000-Da major merozoite surface antigen (gp195) of the FUP (Uganda-Palo Alto) isolate of Plasmodium falciparum, a strain widely used for monkey vaccination experiments, has been cloned and sequenced. The translated amino acid sequence of the FUP gp195 protein is closely related to the sequences of corresponding proteins of the CAMP (Malaysia) and MAD-20 (Papua New Guinea) isolates and more distantly related to those of the Wellcome (West Africa) and K1 (Thailand) isolates, supporting the proposed allelic dimorphism of gp195 within the parasite population. The prevalence of dimorphic sequences within the gp195 protein suggests that many gp195 epitopes would be group-specific. Despite the extensive differences in amino acid sequence between gp195 proteins of these two groups, the hydropathy profiles of proteins representative of both groups are very similar. The conservation of overall secondary structure shown by the hydropathy profile comparison indicates that gp195 proteins of the various P. falciparum isolates are functionally equivalent. This information on the primary structure of the FUP gp195 protein will enable us to evaluate the possible roles of conserved, group-specific and variable epitopes in immunity to the blood stage of the malaria parasite.",1988
s74530,clinical applications of carcinoembryonic antigen.,"clinical applications of carcinoembryonic antigen.. Although carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) has been the subject of interest for many investigators for over 20 years, many questions still remain unanswered concerning the CEA molecule. These include the ultimate clinical potential of CEA as a tumor marker (specificity, sensitivity, distribution), the biological role of CEA, and the genetic control of CEA synthesis. Initially, much of the work with CEA concerned its physicochemical and immunochemical properties, as well as of cross-reacting molecules, and methods of serologic detection of CEA. More recent studies have focused on cloning of the CEA gene and genetic control of CEA production. An extensive literature exists concerning the role of serum CEA assays and their potential value in determining the prognosis and monitoring of patients affected with cancers of various organs. Despite extensive research into the biology of CEA, few papers deal with the application of CEA immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry as concerns normal cellular development, the degree of tumor anaplasia, and the various diagnostic problems of surgical pathology. There has also been a great deal of interest in the utility of both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to CEA both in the radioimmunolocalization and potential therapy of CEA-producing tumors. This review summarizes the past and current findings of the clinical applicability of the serum measurement of CEA and examines the status of radioimmunolocalization of tumors as a basis for effective antibody targeted immunotherapy in the future.",1988
s74574,antigenic and functional characterization of a rat central nervous system-derived cell line immortalized by a retroviral vector.,"antigenic and functional characterization of a rat central nervous system-derived cell line immortalized by a retroviral vector.. We have immortalized rat central nervous system (CNS) cells of primary cultures of rat optic nerve with murine leukemia virus psi-2,SV-40-6, which is defective in assembly and contains the SV-40 large T antigen and neomycin resistance genes, to produce a cell line that we named A7. After drug selection, greater than 90% of the growing cells expressed nuclear SV-40 large T cells and a fraction of these contained the astrocyte-specific marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein. The majority of these cells also expressed surface marker A4 (specific for neural tube derivatives), Ran 2, p185 (the 185-kD phosphoprotein product of the neu oncogene), and fibronectin, but did not express the astrocyte enzymes glutamine synthetase and monoamine oxidase B. Surface markers characteristic of glial progenitors (A2B5) and oligodendrocytes (galactocerebroside) were not detected. After two rounds of cell cloning, subclone A7.6-3 expressed Ran 2, fibronectin, and the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) but not glial fibrillary acidic protein and A4. The A7 cell line and subclones also displayed certain functions of type 1 astrocytes: the conditioned medium of these cells had a potent mitogenic activity for glial progenitor cells which could be neutralized by anti-platelet-derived growth factor antibodies and monolayers of these cells supported the growth of embryonic hypothalamic neurons. We conclude that a retrovirus containing SV-40 large T antigen can immortalize rat CNS cells and that such immortalized glial cells retain at least two important functions of type 1 astrocytes: the ability to secrete platelet-derived growth factor and to support the growth of embryonic CNS neurons. Moreover, such stable immortalized clonal cell lines can be used to study gene regulation in glial cells.",1988
s74581,hla-b27 in inbred and non-inbred transgenic mice. cell surface expression and recognition as an alloantigen in the absence of human beta 2-microglobulin.,"hla-b27 in inbred and non-inbred transgenic mice. cell surface expression and recognition as an alloantigen in the absence of human beta 2-microglobulin.. A gene encoding the H chain of the human class I MHC Ag HLA-B27 was introduced into the germ lines of inbred C57BL/6 (B6) and non-inbred (B6 X SJL/J) F2 mice. By immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, the HLA-B27 gene product was expressed on lymphoid cells at levels comparable to the endogenous H-2b and H-2s class I MHC molecules. In both primary and secondary MLC between responder spleen cells from non-transgenic (B6 X SJL/J) F1 mice and transgenic stimulator cells, CTL were generated that specifically lysed mouse L cell (H-2k) or human B cell targets expressing HLA-B27, and this lysis thus appeared largely unrestricted by H-2. These results indicate that transgenic mice express a functional HLA-B27 gene product on cell surfaces in the absence of the human beta 2-microglobulin gene. These transgenic mice promise to be a valuable resource in the investigation of the unique role of HLA-B27 in inflammatory human disease.",1988
s74588,co-expression of the hepatitis b surface and core antigens using baculovirus multiple expression vectors.,"co-expression of the hepatitis b surface and core antigens using baculovirus multiple expression vectors.. The hepatitis B (HB) virus DNA sequences coding for the pre-core (preC) or C antigens (HBpcAg, HBcAg) have been inserted into the baculovirus plasmid transfer vector, pAcYM1, such that the HB viral sequences are under the control of the polyhedrin promoter of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV). Spodoptera frugiperda cells infected with either of the derived recombinant plasmids in the presence of infectious AcNPV DNA yielded recombinant, polyhedrin-negative viruses that expressed high levels of the respective HBpcAg or HBcAg (representing approx. 5 to 10% and approx. 40% of the stained cellular proteins, respectively). The particulate 27 nm HBcAgs have been purified to homogeneity from infected cell extracts by density gradient centrifugation. Dual expression transfer vectors containing the HBcAg gene sequences and the coding sequences of the HB viral S antigen (HBsAg), each gene under the control of its own copy of the polyhedrin promoter, have also been constructed and used to derive recombinant viruses. The recombinant with the HB C and S genes expressed high levels of the HBcAg (approx. 40% of the cellular proteins) and low levels of the HBsAg (approx. 2% of the stained cellular proteins). Dual expression, occluded, recombinant baculoviruses that make HBsAg, as well as the AcNPV polyhedrin protein, have been prepared that are highly infectious for Trichoplusia ni caterpillars, allowing reproducible preparation of the antigen in larvae. Using radioimmunoassays (RIAs) and ELISAs, the recombinant HBcAg (RIA) and HBsAg (ELISA) have been used to identify human antibodies to HB virus with results that compare favourably with the data obtained with non-recombinant antigens.",1988
s74597,recombinant retroviruses encoding cell surface antigens as selectable markers.,"recombinant retroviruses encoding cell surface antigens as selectable markers.. Recombinant retroviruses are frequently used in the transfer and analysis of genes. This report describes new retrovirus vectors that incorporate a cDNA copy of a cell surface antigen to function as a selectable marker. By using techniques based on quantitative cell surface immunofluorescence, these vectors allow the rapid detection and isolation of infected cells. These vectors also allow the rapid detection of packaging cell lines producing large amounts of recombinant retroviruses. Potential applications of these vectors are demonstrated.",1988
s74737,genetic fusion of a non-toxic heat-stable enterotoxin-related decapeptide antigen to cholera toxin b-subunit.,"genetic fusion of a non-toxic heat-stable enterotoxin-related decapeptide antigen to cholera toxin b-subunit.. A decapeptide highly homologous to the STa Escherichia coli heat-stable enterotoxin and to several other heat-stable enterotoxins was fused genetically to the amino-end of the B-subunit of cholera toxin (CTB) and the hybrid protein gene expressed from a tacP overexpression system. The STa-related decapeptide used, which was encoded by a synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide, contained a single mutation which substituted a disulfide-linked cysteine by alanine. After its fusion to CTB the decapeptide was able to both react with and to give rise to anti-STa antibodies. Expression of the decapeptide-CTB hybrid by non-toxigenic Vibrio cholerae resulted in its full secretion into the extracellular milieu from where it could then be readily purified by single-step affinity chromatography using immobilized GM1 ganglioside. Bacteria producing this non-toxic, immunogenic decapeptide-CTB toxoid might be useful for the development of oral vaccines against diarrhea caused by E. coli and other bacteria producing immunologically related heat-stable enterotoxins, and as a source of immunoreagents for methods used to diagnose disease caused by these bacteria.",1988
s74755,construction and characterization of vaccine strains of salmonella harboring mutations in two different aro genes.,"construction and characterization of vaccine strains of salmonella harboring mutations in two different aro genes.. Derivatives of the mouse-virulent Salmonella typhimurium strain SL1344 were constructed harboring stable mutations in aroC alone or in aroC and aroA together. Fifty percent lethal doses after intravenous inoculation of the mutants into BALB/c mice were determined, and the mutants were as highly attenuated as were SL1344 aroA derivatives. All aro-dependent derivatives persisted in vivo at similar levels and for similar intervals in the livers and spleens of BALB/c mice infected intravenously. Mice vaccinated orally with 10(10) live organisms of the different derivatives survived and were well protected against oral challenge with virulent S. typhimurium. A Salmonella typhi Ty2 derivative, designated WBL2000, was constructed that harbors well-defined, stable mutations in both aroA and aroC.",1988
s75092,nucleotide sequence of the invasion plasmid antigen b and c genes (ipab and ipac) of shigella flexneri.,"nucleotide sequence of the invasion plasmid antigen b and c genes (ipab and ipac) of shigella flexneri.. The nucleotide sequence of a 4.8 kilobase (kb) HindIII fragment from pWR100, the virulence plasmid of Shigella flexneri 5, was determined and analysed. This fragment encodes polypeptides b (62 kilodalton, kD) and c (43 kD) which have already been described as two of the four immunogenic polypeptides of Shigellae. The nucleotide sequence revealed that in addition to the ipaB and ipaC genes encoding polypeptides b and c, a third complete open reading frame was found within the fragment. The gene, named ippI, encoded a 17 kD polypeptide. The deduced amino acids sequence of polypeptides b and c showed no signal peptide but presence of highly hydrophobic domains compatible with a transmembraneous location. The surprising A and T richness of the three genes as compared with the Escherichia coli and Shigella genomes, resulted in a biased codon usage, and raises the question of the origin of the sequences.",1988
s75276,allelic dimorphism in a surface antigen gene of the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum.,"allelic dimorphism in a surface antigen gene of the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum.. Merozoites of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum carry surface proteins processed from a precursor termed p190 or p195. Polymorphism has been reported in this protein. Since the protein is a candidate for a malaria vaccine, it is important to understand the nature of this polymorphism. We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the p190 gene from the MAD20 strain (a Papua New Guinea isolate). Comparisons of the gene with that from other strains of P. falciparum allowed us to study the genetic basis of the antigen's polymorphism. The gene consists of sequences distributed in variable blocks, which are separated by conserved or semi-conserved sequences. Variable sequences occur both in regions that code for tripeptide repeats and in regions with no apparent repeats. Interestingly, according to the present data, variable sequences are not widely polymorphic but fall into two distinct types. We argue that the p190 protein is encoded by dimorphic alleles capable of limited genetic exchange and present evidence at the nucleotide level documenting intragenic recombination in Plasmodium.",1987
s75539,a genetically engineered murine/human chimeric antibody retains specificity for human tumor-associated antigen.,"a genetically engineered murine/human chimeric antibody retains specificity for human tumor-associated antigen.. Chimeric immunoglobulin genes were constructed by fusing murine variable region exons to human constant region exons. The ultimate goal was to produce an antibody capable of escaping surveillance by the human immune system while retaining the tumor specificity of a murine monoclonal. The murine variable regions were isolated from the functionally expressed kappa and gamma 1 immunoglobulin genes of the murine hybridoma cell line B6.2, the secreted monoclonal antibody of which reacts with a surface antigen from human breast, lung, and colon carcinomas. The kappa and gamma 1 chain fusion genes were co-introduced into non-antibody producing murine myeloma cells by electroporation. Transfectants that produced murine/human chimeric antibody were obtained at high frequency as indicated by immunoblots probed with an antisera specific for human immunoglobulin. Enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay analysis demonstrated that this chimeric antibody was secreted from the myeloma cells and retained the ability to bind selectively to membrane prepared from human tumor cells. The chimeric immunoglobulin was also shown by indirect fluorescence microscopy to bind to intact human carcinoma cells with specificity expected of B6.2. The ability of chimeric antibody to recognize human tumor-associated antigen makes feasible a novel approach to cancer immunotherapy.",1986
s75540,synergy between the t3/antigen receptor complex and tp44 in the activation of human t cells.,"synergy between the t3/antigen receptor complex and tp44 in the activation of human t cells.. In addition to the T3/antigen receptor complex (T3/Ti), other T cell surface molecules participate in early events involved in human T cell activation. In this report we document that monoclonal antibody 9.3, which recognizes a 90,000 dalton homodimer expressed on human T cells, synergizes with ligands reacting with T3/Ti to activate purified T cells and Jurkat, a human T cell leukemic line. Unlike phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), 9.3 was able to synergize only with anti-T3 or anti-Ti if these antibodies were immobilized. Moreover, 9.3 failed to synergize with the calcium ionophore ionomycin. At high concentrations only, 9.3 could synergize with PMA in the activation of Jurkat and a T3/Ti negative mutant of Jurkat. At such high concentrations of 9.3, small transient increases in cytoplasmic free calcium ((Ca++)i) were detected in quin 2-loaded Jurkat cells. This increase in (Ca++)i was the result of release of internal stores of calcium. 9.3 induced the hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides, albeit the magnitude of inositol phosphates generated in response to 9.3 was substantially less than that observed with anti-Ti. No effect on pkC translocation was observed in Jurkat cells stimulated with 9.3. Although the small increase in (Ca++)i induced by 9.3 may account for its synergy with PMA, this effect is unlikely to account for the more potent synergistic effect observed with 9.3 and phytohemagglutinin or immobilized anti-T3 and anti-Ti antibodies.",1986
s75621,cloning of the structural genes of three h8 antigens and of protein iii of neisseria gonorrhoeae.,"cloning of the structural genes of three h8 antigens and of protein iii of neisseria gonorrhoeae.. A bank of gonococcal DNA was constructed in the lambda gt11 expression vector. immunological screening of the bank resulted in the isolation of a clone that contains the structural gene of protein III. In addition, several clones reactive with mAbs specific for the H8 antigen were isolated. DNA hybridization studies revealed that these H8-reactive clones were derived from three different gonococcal genes. When the products produced by these clones were used to absorb antibodies from a rabbit antiserum, and the eluted antibodies were used in immunological studies, it could be shown that the parent gonococcus expressed the product of two of these H8 genes, and in strain R10, these had Mr of approximately 19,700 21,200 respectively. The larger form has not been recognized hitherto because the epitope reactive with the H8 mAb may be masked in this product.",1986
s75648,opacity genes in neisseria gonorrhoeae: control of phase and antigenic variation.,"opacity genes in neisseria gonorrhoeae: control of phase and antigenic variation.. The chromosome of N. gonorrhoeae contains several complete expression genes coding for variant opacity proteins. DNA sequence analysis of two opacity genes derived from the same locus (opaE1) of two isogenic gonococcal variants reveals common and variable regions in these genes. Genomic blotting experiments using synthetic probes suggest gene conversion as a principle for the assembly of variant sequence information in opacity genes. The 5' region of opacity genes is composed of identical pentameric pyrimidine units (CTCTT) encoding the hydrophobic portion of the opacity leader peptide. This coding repeat is variable in a given locus with respect of the number of pentameric units. While all expression loci in a single cell are constitutively transcribed, the production of opacity proteins is determined by the coding repeat sequence on the translational level.",1986
s75675,identification of paramyosin as schistosome antigen recognized by intradermally vaccinated mice.,"identification of paramyosin as schistosome antigen recognized by intradermally vaccinated mice.. Mice immunized intradermally with extracts of Schistosoma mansoni in combination with the adjuvant BCG are significantly protected against subsequent infection with living larval forms of the parasite. Remarkably, these vaccinated animals produce antibodies predominantly against a single parasite protein of molecular weight 97 kilodaltons (Sm-97). A complementary DNA that encodes about half of the Sm-97 molecule has now been cloned and sequenced. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence reveals a protein containing periodic repeats of hydrophobic amino acids characteristic of an alpha-helical coiled-coil structure. The deduced amino acid composition of the cloned gene and several properties of the native protein are similar to that of paramyosin, an alpha-helical protein that forms the core for myosin filaments in invertebrate muscle. Paramyosin was isolated from Schistosoma mansoni adult worms and antibodies to Sm-97 were shown to react with this molecule as well as with a known paramyosin from molluscan muscle.",1986
s75721,synergism in the activation of human cd8 t cells by cross-linking the t-cell receptor complex with the cd8 differentiation antigen.,"synergism in the activation of human cd8 t cells by cross-linking the t-cell receptor complex with the cd8 differentiation antigen.. Resting human T cells can be activated and induced to proliferate by cross-linking the T-cell receptor complex (Ti/CD3) with anti-CD3 (T3) antibodies, such as OKT3, together with interleukin 2. Here we describe functional properties of another monoclonal anti-CD3 antibody (BMA 030) that, cross-linked in various ways, only weakly stimulates accessory-cell-depleted T-cell cultures. However, when cross-linked to anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 antibodies a markedly enhanced proliferation of the corresponding subpopulation is observed. We have concentrated on the analysis of CD8 cells and have found that BMA 030, when cross-linked together with anti-CD8 (T811), induced proliferation more than 100-fold greater than BMA 030 alone, whereas cross-linking with antibodies to other T-cell membrane antigens (HLA-A, B, or CD5) provided no or marginal synergistic signals. There was no synergistic effect when only one of the two antibodies, BMA 030 or T811, was cross-linked and the other was applied in soluble form. In contrast, each of the two antibodies alone, when applied in soluble form, inhibited activation induced by the cross-linked antibodies. The T-cell differentiation antigen CD8 has been implicated in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I restricted specificity of CD8 T cells. In previous work from other laboratories only the negative influences of soluble anti-CD8 antibodies have been noted. In contrast, our results suggest that cross-linking between Ti/CD3 and CD8 may be a critical event in the activation of mature CD8 cells. We hypothesize that, in antigen-induced T-cell activation, CD8 and Ti/CD3 become cross-linked by their simultaneous binding to class I-associated structures. Such a mechanism, if required for proliferation in early T-cell ontogeny, could generate a selective pressure for CD8 cells to recognize class I-associated antigens.",1986
s75744,n-myc amplification causes down-modulation of mhc class i antigen expression in neuroblastoma.,"n-myc amplification causes down-modulation of mhc class i antigen expression in neuroblastoma.. Amplification of the N-myc gene is correlated with increased metastatic ability of human neuroblastomas. We show here that overexpression of the N-myc gene in a rat neuroblastoma cell line following gene transfer causes down-modulation of class I histocompatibility antigen expression and increases in the in vivo growth rate and metastatic ability of these cells. N-myc-mediated down-modulation of MHC class I antigen expression could be reversed by treatment with interferon without affecting the steady state level of N-myc mRNA. No effect on MHC class I antigen expression was found when the N-myc gene was expressed in rat fibroblasts, indicating that some of the effects caused by N-myc gene amplification are cell-type-specific.",1986
s75915,structure of the gene encoding the circumsporozoite protein of plasmodium yoelii. a rodent model for examining antimalarial sporozoite vaccines.,"structure of the gene encoding the circumsporozoite protein of plasmodium yoelii. a rodent model for examining antimalarial sporozoite vaccines.. The gene encoding the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) from the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium yoelii, has been cloned and the nucleotide sequence has been determined. The gene encodes a protein of 367 amino acids as deduced from the nucleotide sequence. This gene is structurally similar to other Plasmodium spp. CSP genes in that it contains putative hydrophobic signal and anchor sequences at the NH2 and COOH termini, respectively, two small regions (Regions I and II) that are conserved in all CSP genes analyzed to date, and a central region containing the immunodominant repeating peptide sequence. Unlike other CSP genes, however, the immunodominant repeat region of the gene is composed of two distinctly different types of tandem repeats. One repeating unit is six amino acids (Gln-Gly-Pro-Gly-Ala-Pro) in length while the other is only four (Gln-Gln-Pro-Pro) residues long. A synthetic peptide, Gln-Gly-Pro-Gly-Ala-Pro X 3, strongly inhibits the binding of anti-CSP monoclonal antibody to sporozoite antigens while another peptide, Gln-Gln-Pro-Pro X 4, weakly inhibits the binding of this same antibody to sporozoite antigens. This work should allow the construction of a mouse model system to parallel human vaccine trials.",1987
s75954,alternative splicing and alternative initiation of translation explain the four forms of the ia antigen-associated invariant chain.,"alternative splicing and alternative initiation of translation explain the four forms of the ia antigen-associated invariant chain.. The Ia antigen-associated invariant chain (In) exists in humans as four related polypeptides, p33, p35, p41 and p43, all associated with HLA-class II antigens. As described previously, two of these forms of In chain, p33 and p35, result from the use of two in-phase initiation AUG codons on the unique In p33 mRNA. In addition to cDNA clones derived from In p33 mRNA, we have isolated a new cDNA clone, called p41-1, which differs from p33-1 by an additional segment in the coding region. The DNA sequence encoding the segment unique to p41-1 was identified in the genomic sequence in the intron between exon 6 and 7, and we refer to it as exon 6b. Cells transfected with a full length p41 cDNA clone in an expression vector synthesize the two larger forms of the In chain, p41 and p43. We propose that the larger mRNA, encoding p41, results from alternative splicing of exon 6b, and that p41 and p43 result from the use of the two functional initiation AUG codons identified in p33 mRNA. Alternative splicing, together with alternative initiation of translation, allows therefore the synthesis of four related In chain polypeptides from a single gene.",1986
s75986,genes for the major protein antigens of mycobacterium tuberculosis: the etiologic agents of tuberculosis and leprosy share an immunodominant antigen.,"genes for the major protein antigens of mycobacterium tuberculosis: the etiologic agents of tuberculosis and leprosy share an immunodominant antigen.. Mycobacterium tuberculosis genes encoding immunologically relevant proteins were isolated by systematically screening a lambda gt11 recombinant DNA expression library with a collection of murine monoclonal antibodies directed against protein antigens of this pathogen. These antibodies, previously characterized by a World Health Organization workshop on monoclonal antibodies against mycobacteria, were used to isolate DNA sequences encoding five major protein antigens of this pathogen. To evaluate the extent of crossreactivity between these M. tuberculosis antigens and antigens of Mycobacterium leprae, recombinant antigens were probed with monoclonal antibodies directed against the protein antigens of these bacilli. One of the antigens, a 65-kDa protein, has determinants common to M. tuberculosis and M. leprae. We find not only that this antigen is recognized by mouse monoclonal antibodies but that it is the major protein recognized by anti-M. tuberculosis rabbit sera. The 65-kDa proteins of M. tuberculosis and M. leprae appear to play a role in the humoral and cell-mediated immune response to these pathogens.",1987
s76043,live oral salmonella vaccines: potential use of attenuated strains as carriers of heterologous antigens to the immune system.,"live oral salmonella vaccines: potential use of attenuated strains as carriers of heterologous antigens to the immune system.. Live attenuated strains of salmonellae are showing promise as live oral vaccines against human typhoid fever and other Salmonella infections of man and animals. Attenuation can be achieved by introducing genetically defined, non-reverting mutations into specific genes on the Salmonella chromosome. Mutations in the gal E or aroA genes of Salmonella inhibit the ability of the bacteria to grow in vivo, and strains carrying such lesions are effective vaccines against salmonellosis. Genetic determinants encoding for the expression of potentially protective antigens from heterologous, non-Salmonella pathogens can be readily introduced into these attenuated Salmonella strains. Expression of the heterologous antigen does not affect the ability of the Salmonella host to be used as a Salmonella vaccine. Mice infected orally with a Salmonella typhimurium aroA vaccine expressing the Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin B subunit developed both a secretory and serum antibody response to this antigen. These serum antibodies were able to neutralise the activity of E. coli heat-labile toxin in tissue culture assays. A humoral and cell-mediated (DTH) immune response was detected against beta galactosidase, an intracellular antigen, in mice infected with an aroA vaccine expressing this cloned antigen. The prospects for the development of live Salmonella vaccines as a method for delivering heterologous antigens derived from bacteria, viruses and parasites is discussed.",1987

The aim of the current study was to determine the ability of antigen-driven cloned helper cell independent cytotoxic T lymphocytes (HITc) to proliferate and to survive in vivo and to mediate tumor therapy. The HITc clone utilized (denoted 1.B6) was specifically cytolytic to FBL-3, a syngeneic Friend virus-induced murine leukemia.

The ability of cloned HITc to proliferate and to survive in vivo was examined in cyclophosphamide (CY) pretreated donor mice congenic for the Thy-1 gene. Adoptively transferred cloned HITc could be found in large numbers, and were widely distributed in vivo 1 wk after transfer. In tumor therapy, 1.B6 cells when injected into a site of tumor (i.p.) and used as an adjunct to CY were effective against disseminated FBL-3. In this circumstance, cloned 1.B6 cells could be recovered from cured mice 125 days after transfer and were shown to specifically lyse tumor and proliferate in vitro in response to FBL-3. Thus as an adjunct to CY, tumor-specific cloned HITc are capable of eradicating disseminated leukemia, persisting long-term in vivo, and providing specific immunologic memory.",1987

Most of these variants express potent transplantation antigens which are not present on the original P815 tumor cells. These tum- antigens, which appear to be specific for each variant, elicit a strong cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) response, but do not seem to induce a specific antibody response. As a first step in the isolation of the gene of a tum- antigen, we attempted DNA-mediated gene transfer. As a DNA recipient cell we used P1.HTR, a highly transfectable P815 cell line, whose selection has been previously described. For the detection of antigen-expressing cells in transfected populations we developed a procedure that relies on the ability of these cells to stimulate the proliferation of the relevant CTL. Using DNA from tum- variant P91 mixed with a plasmid carrying an antibiotic resistance gene, we obtained several independent transfectants expressing a tum- antigen, at a frequency of approximately 1 in 13,000 antibiotic-resistant transfectants. These transfectants express only one of the two tum- antigens that were identified on P91, suggesting that these tum- antigens correspond to different genes. We expect that the detection procedure described here will be suitable for the identification of transfectants for any gene that determines the expression of an antigen recognized by CTL.",1987
s76381,allergenic and blastogenic reactivity of three antigens from mycobacterium tuberculosis in sensitized guinea pigs.,"allergenic and blastogenic reactivity of three antigens from mycobacterium tuberculosis in sensitized guinea pigs.. Three antigens from a culture filtrate of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv were purified by affinity chromatography, using monoclonal antibodies. The molecular weights of the purified antigens are 17,000 to 19,000, 32,000 to 33,000, and 39,000, respectively, and by their migration patterns in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing and nonreducing conditions, they all appeared to be single-chain polypeptides. Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analyses indicated that the antigens are non-cross-reactive. All antigens generated an intermediate to strong skin reaction when tested in guinea pigs previously immunized with a live M. bovis BCG vaccine or with an oil emulsion preparation of phenol-or heat-killed M. tuberculosis. Lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood or lymph nodes of similarly immunized guinea pigs could be stimulated by purified protein derivative and the purified antigens. Qualitative differences in stimulatory capacity between the preparations were demonstrated. The antigens may prove useful in further studies of the immunology and pathogenesis of tuberculosis.",1987

Homologous regions of five amino acids each, were identified in the NH2-terminal domain of human class II beta chains and the COOH terminus of HIV I envelope protein. The homologous regions are highly conserved among different DR and DQ alleles and also among different isolates of HIV. Septamers containing these sequences were synthesized and used for the generation of murine mAbs. The mAbs selected for this study were raised against the HIV I-derived peptide and reacted strongly not only with the immunizing peptide, but also with the homologous class II-derived peptide. These mAbs also reacted with native MHC class II antigens expressed on human B cell lines and on murine fibroblast L cell lines transfected with the genes coding for the alpha and beta chains of human class II antigens. Furthermore, sera from 36% of AIDS patients tested contained antibodies that reacted with the class II-derived peptide, as well as with intact class II molecule-rich cell extracts. Such antibodies in HIV I-infected individuals may recognize self class II antigens, triggering autoimmune mechanisms that could contribute to the development of immunodeficiency in AIDS patients.",1988

Transfection of P815 cell line P1.HTR with DNA of tum- variant P91 yielded transfectants expressing tum- antigen P91A. They were detected by their ability to stimulate proliferation of cytolytic T lymphocytes [Wolfel, T., Van Pel, A., De Plaen, E., Lurquin, C., Maryanski, J. L. & Boon, T. (1987) Immunogenetics 26, 178-187]. A cosmid library of a cell line expressing antigen P91A was transfected into P1.HTR. Transfectants expressing the antigen were obtained. By packaging directly the DNA of a transfectant with lambda phage extracts, we obtained a small cosmid population containing as major component a cosmid that transferred the expression of P91A. The assay of various restriction fragments of this cosmid led to the isolation of an 800-base-pair fragment containing the P91A sequence required for transfection. Comparison with a homologous cDNA showed that this fragment contained only one of the several exons of the P91A gene. The normal and the tum- forms of the gene differ by one nucleotide located in this 137-base-pair exon. The essential role of this mutation, which produces an amino acid change, was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. No significant sequence similarity was found between the 800-base-pair fragment and any recorded gene.",1988
s76658,"recent advances in the development of an improved, human anthrax vaccine.","recent advances in the development of an improved, human anthrax vaccine.. Human anthrax vaccines currently licensed in the United States and Western Europe consist of alum-precipitated or aluminum hydroxide-adsorbed supernatant material from fermentor cultures of toxigenic, nonencapsulated strains of Bacillus anthracis. These vaccines have several drawbacks, including the need for frequent boosters, the apparent inability to protect adequately against certain strains of B. anthracis, and occasional local reactogenicity. Studies are being undertaken to develop an improved human anthrax vaccine which is safe and efficacious, and which provides long-lasting immunity. Aspects being studied include the identification of antigens and epitopes responsible for eliciting protective immunity, the mechanisms of resistance to anthrax infection, the role of specific antibody in resistance, the differences in immunity elicited by living and chemical vaccines, the potential of new adjuvants to augment immunity, and the feasibility of developing safe vaccine strains having mutationally altered toxin genes. Both living and non-living (chemical) prototype vaccines are being developed and tested.",1988
s76673,synthetic peptides as antigens and competitors in recognition by h-2-restricted cytolytic t cells specific for hla.,"synthetic peptides as antigens and competitors in recognition by h-2-restricted cytolytic t cells specific for hla.. The specificity of peptide recognition by a number of Kd-restricted CTL clones specific for HLA-CW3 or HLA-A24 was investigated. The CTL clones were derived from DBA/2 (H-2d) mice immunized with syngeneic P815 mouse cells transfected with genes encoding HLA-CW3 or HLA-A24 class I molecules. We had previously shown that CTL clones that lysed P815-CW3 transfectant target cells could lyse P815 (HLA-) target cells incubated with synthetic CW3 peptides corresponding to the COOH-terminal end of the alpha 2 domain. In the present study, we found that Kd-restricted CTL clones that lysed P815-A24 transfectant target cells recognized a synthetic peptide from the same region (residues 170-182) of the A24 molecule. CW3 and A24 differ by only one amino acid within this region. Recognition of CW3 or A24 peptides corresponded exactly with lysis of P815-HLA transfectants both for clones that mutually exclusively lysed CW3 or A24 transfectant target cells and for CW3/A24 crossreactive CTL clones. The latter CTL clones that lysed both CW3 and A24 transfectant target cells showed a clear preference for the peptide corresponding to the immunizing HLA allele. The homologous CW3 and A24 peptides could compete with each other for recognition, in contrast to a peptide from the same region of HLA-B7. Peptides from the corresponding region of the endogenous Kd and Dd/Ld molecules could also inhibit recognition of CW3 and A24 peptides. Competition with peptides apparently occurred at the level of the target cell. These results are consistent with a model whereby MHC class I molecules position protein fragments or peptides for specific recognition by T cells.",1988
s77077,single-chain antigen-binding proteins.,"single-chain antigen-binding proteins.. Single-chain antigen-binding proteins are novel recombinant polypeptides, composed of an antibody variable light-chain amino acid sequence (VL) tethered to a variable heavy-chain sequence (VH) by a designed peptide that links the carboxyl terminus of the VL sequence to the amino terminus of the VH sequence. These proteins have the same specificities and affinities for their antigens as the monoclonal antibodies whose VL and VH sequences were used to construct the recombinant genes that were expressed in Escherichia coli. Three of these proteins, one derived from the sequence for a monoclonal antibody to growth hormone and two derived from the sequences of two different monoclonal antibodies to fluorescein, were designed, constructed, synthesized, purified, and assayed. These proteins are expected to have significant advantages over monoclonal antibodies in a number of applications.",1988

A number of nonliving mycobacterial preparations were tested in vivo for their capacity to generate various relevant parameters of cellular immunity. All preparations tested had some detectable activity in raising resistance to challenge with Mycobacterium tuberculosis or with Listeria monocytogenes and in conferring the ability to mount a delayed-type hypersensitivity response to tuberculin. This report presents the first evidence, however, that none of these preparations were able to generate protective T cells capable of adoptive immunization against virulent tuberculosis. These data are discussed in terms of the use of these preparations in generating M. tuberculosis-reactive T-cell lines and the application of these lines in the continuing search for an improved vaccine against tuberculosis.",1988
s77113,cloning and high level expression of a chimeric antibody with specificity for human carcinoembryonic antigen.,"cloning and high level expression of a chimeric antibody with specificity for human carcinoembryonic antigen.. A mouse/human chimeric antibody has been constructed by using variable light and variable heavy regions from a murine hybridoma specific for human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (CEM231.6.7). These V regions were combined with kappa and gamma-1 constant region genes cloned from human lymphocytes. The chimeric constructs were sequentially electroporated into murine non-Ig-producing myeloma (P3.653) and hybridoma (SP2/0) cell. Significant differences were seen in expression levels between the two cell types. High levels of expression (24 to 32 micrograms/ml/10(6) cells) were seen with several of the anti-CEA SP2/0 transfectomas but not with the P3.653 cells. The SP2/0 transfectoma lines were adapted to serum-free, chemically defined media and grown in large scale fermentation cultures where they continued to secrete high levels of antibody. The chimeric antibodies remain reactive against human CEA with affinity constants comparable to that of the parental hybridoma antibody. High level expression will make practical the production of chimeric antibodies for in vivo therapeutic and diagnostic purposes.",1988
s77139,immunochemical characterization of the polysaccharide antigens of group b streptococci.,"immunochemical characterization of the polysaccharide antigens of group b streptococci.. Mouse monoclonal antibodies were used in the immunochemical characterization of the polysaccharide antigens of group B streptococci (GBS). Monoclonal antibodies specific for the sialylated form of the GBS type III polysaccharide were highly protective in a mouse model of GBS type III infection, whether of IgM, IgG2a, or IgA isotypes, but monoclonal antibodies specific for the nonsialylated form of the type III antigen were not protective, regardless of isotype. Monoclonal antibodies reacting with the type II polysaccharide antigen could be divided into two general antigen binding groups on the basis of the ability of beta-methylgalactopyranoside to inhibit their binding to purified type II antigen. Various proportions of antibodies with the two specificities were observed in rabbit and human sera. Although it was previously reported that rabbit antisera could not distinguish between the sialylated and nonsialylated forms of the type Ib polysaccharide, mouse monoclonal antibodies were found to exhibit exclusive specificity for one or the other form of the antigen. Only monoclonal antibodies specific for the sialylated Ib polysaccharide were protective in a mouse model.",1988
s77172,mouse/human chimeric antibodies to a tumor-associated antigen: biologic activity of the four human igg subclasses.,mouse/human chimeric antibodies to a tumor-associated antigen: biologic activity of the four human igg subclasses.. Variable region genes from mouse monoclonal antibody 17-1A (gamma 2a kappa) with specificity for human gastrointestinal malignancies have been paired with human immunoglobulin constant region genes (for heavy and light chains) to produce mouse/human chimeric immunoglobulin molecules (chIgG) for each of the four human IgG subclasses. Mouse 17-1A and the four chIgG bound similarly to two human colon cancer cell lines and had comparable binding affinities. The chIgG1 and chIgG3 molecules mediated lymphocyte and monocyte antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) to colon cancer tumor cell lines comparable to that of the parent murine 17-1A. The chIgG2 and chIgG4 molecules were able to mediate ADCC to colon cancer cell lines but were clearly inferior to the chIgG1 and chIgG3 reagents. None of the chIgG antibodies or the murine 17-1A was able to mediate complement lysis of colon cancer cell lines. These studies demonstrate the ability to produce all four human IgG subclass chimeric molecules which retain biologic activity. We have confirmed the subclass preferences of human lymphocyte and monocyte Fc receptors for human IgG subclasses previously determined by studies with monomeric or aggregated IgG. These data may aid in the selection of chimeric antibodies for in vivo trials.,1988
s77210,antigenic relatedness of a strongly immunogenic 65 kda mycobacterial protein antigen with a similarly sized ubiquitous bacterial common antigen.,"antigenic relatedness of a strongly immunogenic 65 kda mycobacterial protein antigen with a similarly sized ubiquitous bacterial common antigen.. In gene libraries of Mycobacterium bovis BCG, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae recombinants were frequently found expressing an immunodominant 65 kDa protein antigen. In this study polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against the 65 kDa antigen were found to react with a variety of different bacteria. Furthermore it is shown that the 65 kDa mycobacterial protein belongs to the family of antigens previously designated 'common antigen' due to their presence in a large variety of bacterial species. The molecular weight of this common antigen in 17 bacterial species was determined and it varied from 59 to 65 kDa. These bacteria included Gram-negative, Gram-positive and archae-bacteria, indicating that this antigen consists of members of an evolutionary well-conserved protein family. The 65 kDa protein was located in the cytoplasmic fraction of both Escherichia coli K12 and M. bovis BCG. Its function for the bacterial cell is presently unknown. The immunological relatedness of this common antigen to the MbaA protein might indicate a role in the etiology of rheumatoid arthritis, as was recently suggested for the mycobacterial 65 kDa antigen.",1988

Beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was associated with alpha-subunit of ovine luteinizing hormone (OLH) to create a heterospecies dimer (HSD) which has a higher steroidogenic potency than the homologous dimer of alpha hCG and beta hCG in the mouse Leydig cell bioassay. The properties and merits of the antibodies induced by this HSD and beta hCG linked to carrier(s) were investigated in rodents and in a subhuman primate species. The antisera had, in both cases, high affinity for binding with hCG (K alpha = 10(9)-10(10) M-1). The mean (+/- S.E.M.) bioneutralization capacity as a percentage of immunoreactivity (determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA)) of the antibodies generated by the HSD-carrier in rats and bonnet monkeys was higher in comparison with those induced by beta hCG linked to carrier (80 +/- 2.3% vs. 63 +/- 1.5% in rats, and 65 +/- 1.9% for HSD vs. 44 +/- 3.7% in monkeys). None of the sera gave any evidence of cross-reactivity with human follicle stimulating hormone (hFSH) and human thyroid stimulating hormone (hTSH).",1988
s77315,sequence and analysis of the dna encoding protective antigen of bacillus anthracis.,"sequence and analysis of the dna encoding protective antigen of bacillus anthracis.. The nucleotide sequence of the protective antigen (PA) gene from Bacillus anthracis and the 5' and 3' flanking sequences were determined. PA is one of three proteins comprising anthrax toxin; and its nucleotide sequence is the first to be reported from B. anthracis. The open reading frame (ORF) is 2319 bp long, of which 2205 bp encode the 735 amino acids of the secreted protein. This region is preceded by 29 codons, which appear to encode a signal peptide having characteristics in common with those of other secreted proteins. A consensus TATAAT sequence was located at the putative -10 promoter site. A Shine-Dalgarno site similar to that found in genes of other Bacillus sp. was located 7 bp upstream from the ATG start codon. The codon usage for the PA gene reflected its high A + T (69%) base composition and differed from those of genes for bacterial proteins from most other sequences examined. The TAA translation stop codon was followed by an inverted repeat forming a potential termination signal. In addition, a 192-codon ORF of unknown significance, theoretically encoding a 21.6-kDa protein, preceded the 5' end of the PA gene.",1988
s77724,typing hepatitis b virus by homology in nucleotide sequence: comparison of surface antigen subtypes.,"typing hepatitis b virus by homology in nucleotide sequence: comparison of surface antigen subtypes.. The complete nucleotide sequences of the DNA of three hepatitis B virus (HBV) genomes of subtype adw, cloned from plasma samples of asymptomatic carriers living in the mainland and Okinawa Prefecture of Japan and Indonesia were determined. All three comprised 3215 bp and differed in sequence by only 3.9 to 5.6%. When these isolates were compared with the reported sequences of two HBV genomes of the same subtype derived from American carriers, however, the differences were greater (8.3 to 9.3% to an extent comparable with the nucleotide divergence between an HBV genome of subtype adw and that of a heterotypic subtype, such as adr, ayw or ayr. A total of 18 HBV genomes of various subtypes, including the three described here, 10 reported previously and five unpublished ones, were classified into four groups based on an inter-group divergence in nucleotide sequence of 8% or greater: group A (two adw genomes), group B (four adw), group C (three adw, four adr and one ayr) and group D (four ayw). Thus, the nine genomes of HBV subtype adw were distributed into three groups with considerably different sequences. These results indicate that the four major antigenically defined subtypes of envelope polypeptide do not reflect true genotypic variation of HBV. The fact that d to y, as well as w to r, subtypic change can be induced by an A----G point mutation at nucleotides 365 and 479 in the S gene, respectively, supports this view.",1988
s77902,molecular analysis of the gene encoding the major surface antigen of toxoplasma gondii.,"molecular analysis of the gene encoding the major surface antigen of toxoplasma gondii.. The complete sequence of P30, the major surface Ag of the protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, has been deduced through the cloning and analysis of its gene. Using polyclonal serum specific for P30, we have isolated a P30 cDNA clone from a lambda gt11 cDNA expression library derived from tachyzoites of T. gondii (RH strain). This clone produces a beta-galactosidase fusion protein which reacts with several anti-P30 mAb. In addition, polyclonal anti-serum raised to the fusion protein reacts with purified P30 protein and exclusively with P30 in a whole cell lysate of T. gondii. This cDNA clone was used to isolate near full-length cDNA molecules and a cosmid clone containing the P30 gene. Sequence analysis of the cDNA reveals a single open reading frame with coding capacity for 34.7 kDa of primary translation product (consistent with the apparent Mr of P30 on SDS-acrylamide gels) including a presumptive hydrophobic signal sequence. The P30 primary translation product also has a carboxy-terminal hydrophobic tail which is predictive of a posttranslational cleavage and modification with a glycolipid anchor. We have identified the apparent 5' and 3' ends of the P30 mRNA transcript which is extremely abundant, 1500 nucleotides in length, and polyadenylated. The P30 gene is single copy and contains no introns.",1988

Two anti-phenyloxazolone (phOx3) and one anti-GAT MAbs from C57BL mice are shown to be coded by VH gene 186.2. This gene has been found earlier to code for several anti-NP (NNP) antibodies (Bothwell et al., 1981) and anti-GT antibodies (Rocca-Serra et al., 1983; Carmack and Pincus, 1986). The L chain partner of the VH 186.2 gene is different in anti-NP and anti-GAT antibodies (Bothwell et al., 1981; Rocca-Serra et al., 1983; Carmack and Pincus, 1986); in anti-phOx antibodies two new unrelated kappa chain V regions were found. Both of the new VK genes involved code frequently for anti-phOx antibodies in BALB/c mice but then with different VH genes. We tested five 186.2-coded antibodies for cross-reactions. Four antibodies were specific, one bound only to NNP, one only to phOx and two only to GT (GAT). The fifth antibody (anti-phOx) bound also to NNP, GAT and ABA-HOP though probably with a low affinity. This is the first demonstration that one V gene can code for three different antibody specificities. It emphasizes the role of the combinatorial element in antibody diversity.",1988
s78819,selective stimulation of human t lymphocyte subsets by heteroconjugates of antibodies to the t cell receptor and to subset-specific differentiation antigens.,"selective stimulation of human t lymphocyte subsets by heteroconjugates of antibodies to the t cell receptor and to subset-specific differentiation antigens.. Ligand binding under conditions that generate microaggregates of the T cell receptor complex (Ti/CD3) with the membrane molecules CD4 or CD8 can induce activation of small resting T lymphocytes. We demonstrate this by using soluble dimeric heteroconjugates consisting of monoclonal antibodies to CD4/CD8 and of a novel anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (BMA030) which even in aggregated form is not stimulatory on its own under limiting conditions in the absence of accessory cells. Using combinations of BMA030 with either anti-CD4 or anti-CD8, the corresponding T cell subpopulation could be selectively expanded in vitro. Selective expansion of T cell subpopulations in vitro or in vivo might be helpful for certain therapeutical manipulations. In addition, this finding may contribute to a better understanding of major histocompatibility complex-restricted T cell activation.",1988
s78904,introduction of soluble protein into the class i pathway of antigen processing and presentation.,"introduction of soluble protein into the class i pathway of antigen processing and presentation.. In order to investigate how peptides associate with class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) glycoproteins intracellularly, we generated cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) specific for a readily available soluble protein in association with class I. C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice immunized against a syngeneic tumor cell transfected with chicken ovalbumin (OVA) cDNA gave rise to H-2Kb-restricted CTL specific for the OVA258-276 peptide. This synthetic peptide and CNBr fragments of OVA (242-285 and 242-273) were able to target H-2b cells for lysis by the CTL in a 3 hr assay. Cells incubated with native OVA for up to 24 hr did not become sensitized for recognition and lysis. However, when OVA was introduced directly into the cytoplasm of cells by the osmotic lysis of pinosomes, the Kb restricted determinant formed readily.",1988

Two phenomena appear to distinguish the D region class I genes from those in the K region in the murine MHC: (a) haplotype disparity in the number of expressed D region class I molecules has been observed; and (b) clines of closely related D region class I molecules among and within mice of different H-2 haplotypes can be defined. Both of these observations have been based on serological and peptide mapping analyses of these molecules. Recent reports using molecular biological approaches have corroborated these findings. Since the mouse strain B10.AKM expresses multiple D region class I antigens, all of which are closely related to the prototypic Ld molecule, we investigated the Dq region of B10.AKM using molecular approaches. Three D region class I genes were isolated from genomic B10.AKM bacteriophage and cosmid libraries. Based on alignment of those genes with the BALB/c D region class I genes by analogous restriction endonuclease sites and by hybridization of one of those genes with a D4d gene-derived oligonucleotide probe, we have designated these genes as Dq, Lq, and D4q. As determined by DNA-mediated gene transfer to mouse L cells followed by serological analyses, the Dq and Lq genes encode previously characterized Dq region class I antigens. The nucleic acid sequence comparisons of the Dq and Lq genes demonstrated a higher level of homology with the Ld and Db genes than with other D region class I genes. In addition, CTL stimulated with a Dq, Lq, or Ld gene transfectant showed strong crossreactions with the other transfectants as targets, suggesting that the products of these genes are also functionally related. Thus, these studies suggest that the L molecule represents a prototypic structure shared by several D region gene products, and furthermore, the duplication of an Ld-like progenitor gene resulted in two Dq region class I genes, Dq and Lq. Unexpectedly, the sequences determined for the Dq and Lq genes are nearly identical to the sequences of two genes, A166 and A149, respectively, which were reported to encode the tumor-specific antigens; these novel class I genes were isolated from an H-2k fibrosarcoma, 1591. This raises the distinct possibility that these purported tumor-specific class I genes were introduced into this tumor by contamination.",1988
s78989,b-cell memory is short-lived in the absence of antigen.,"b-cell memory is short-lived in the absence of antigen.. Primary encounter with antigen stimulates specific B cells not only to differentiate into cells that produce antibody at a high rate (plasma cells), but also to give rise to populations of memory cells. These cells have many characteristics that differ from virgin B cells, including their lifespan. When re-exposed to antigen, memory cells generate secondary IgG responses that are enhanced in rate, titre and affinity. At present they are considered as small resting lymphocytes which survive for long periods in a quiescent state between each antigen encounter. However, the fact that an individual may continue to make an antibody response for many months following a single injection of antigen is often overlooked. This continued antibody production is probably due to repeated stimulation of antigen-specific B cells and raises the question of whether memory B-cell clones require antigen for their maintenance. Here we show that they do, and that following transfer, in the absence of antigen, memory B-cell populations are lost from the adoptive host after 10-12 weeks.",1988

The complete nucleotide sequence of a cloned copy of the HindIII K fragment of the WR strain of vaccinia virus has been determined. Eight open reading frames (ORFs) have been identified, on the basis of size and codon usage. The predicted amino acid sequences of the putative genes have been compared to the Protein Identification Resource and to published vaccinia virus sequences. One gene, predicted to encode a 42.2K protein, is highly related to the family of serine protease inhibitors. It shows approximately 25% identity to human antithrombin III and 19% identity to the cowpox virus 38K protein gene which is also related to serine protease inhibitors. The product of another gene shows a similar high level of identity to the 37K vaccinia virus major envelope antigen. The existence of viable deletion mutants and recombinants containing foreign DNA inserted into both these genes indicates that they are non-essential.",1988
s79232,future prospects for vaccine adjuvants.,"future prospects for vaccine adjuvants.. Since the landmark experiments of Ramon 60 years ago, attempts have been made to augment the humoral and cellular responses to administered antigens in order to develop more potent and less toxic vaccines. The need for an acceptable adjuvant suitable for clinical use has been underscored by recent advances in recombinant biotechnology and synthetic chemistry which have made it possible to create antigens that are smaller and better characterized, yet less immunogenic, than before. It is likely that these antigens will require an adjuvant to achieve protective immunity. Some of these same technological advances, together with a better understanding of the immune system in general, have permitted the study of adjuvants to evolve from an empirical field to a developmental one. This article discusses the currently known agents capable of immunopotentiation and possible strategies for their use in future vaccines.",1988
s79247,a novel method for producing anti-peptide antibodies. production of site-specific antibodies to the t cell antigen receptor beta-chain.,"a novel method for producing anti-peptide antibodies. production of site-specific antibodies to the t cell antigen receptor beta-chain.. Peptide antigens used to generate site-specific antibodies to proteins are of interest in the development of vaccines. The need to conjugate them to a carrier protein for optimal immunogenicity results in a number of problems including a possible immune response to the carrier. Here we describe a new method of synthesizing an immunogenic peptide antigen, referred to as multiple antigenic peptide (MAP), which may render the need for a carrier protein obsolete. A 14-residue sequence derived from the human T cell antigen receptor beta-chain constant region was selected, and the peptide was synthesized directly onto a branching lysine core with 8 copies of the 14-residue peptide linked to the core by the COOH-terminal amino acid. The molecular weight of this structure was 13,422 of which only 7% represents the lysine residues of the core. The octameric MAP was highly immunogenic in mice and rabbits, allowing production of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. The majority of these antibodies reacted with the peptide in its monomeric form as well as its octameric form. Moreover, the antibodies reacted with the intact beta-chain protein. The antigenic determinants of the peptide that were recognized by the antibodies included continuous determinants and conformational determinants. The NH2-terminal residues of the octameric MAP appeared to be most immunogenic. There were no antibodies to the central lysine core. This method of direct synthesis of a polymeric peptide provides accurate knowledge of the conformation and quantity of the peptide prior to immunization, which is usually not the case when peptides are conjugated to carriers. The method is versatile because the possibility exists to synthesize MAP with 16 or 32 peptide arms or to synthesize polymers containing two different peptides.",1988

The T cell antigen receptor is a multi-subunit receptor complex present on the surface of all mature and many developing T cells. It consists of clonotypic heterodimers noncovalently linked to five invariant chains that are encoded by four genes and referred to as the CD3 complex. The CD3 gamma, delta, and epsilon chains have been molecularly characterized. In this report the molecular cloning of a complementary DNA encoding the zeta chain of the murine T cell antigen receptor is described. The predicted protein sequence of the zeta chain suggests a structure distinct from those of any of the previously described receptor subunits.",1988
s79430,oral salmonella typhimurium vaccine expressing circumsporozoite protein protects against malaria.,"oral salmonella typhimurium vaccine expressing circumsporozoite protein protects against malaria.. Immunization with radiation-attenuated malaria sporozoites induces potent cellular immune responses, but the target antigens are unknown and have not previously been elicited by subunit vaccines prepared from the circumsporozoite (CS) protein. A method is described here for inducing protective cell-mediated immunity to sporozoites by immunization with attenuated Salmonella typhimurium transformed with the Plasmodium berghei CS gene. These transformants constitutively express CS antigens and, when used to immunize mice orally, colonize the liver, induce antigen-specific cell-mediated immunity, and protect mice against sporozoite challenge in the absence of antisporozoite antibodies. These data indicate that the CS protein contains T cell epitopes capable of inducing protective cell-mediated immunity, and emphasize the importance of proper antigen presentation in generating this response. Analogous, orally administered vaccines against human malaria might be feasible.",1988
s79443,heterologous expression of the 65-kilodalton antigen of mycobacterium leprae and murine t-cell responses to the gene product.,"heterologous expression of the 65-kilodalton antigen of mycobacterium leprae and murine t-cell responses to the gene product.. The gene encoding the immunodominant 65-kilodalton antigen of Mycobacterium leprae was subcloned from a lambda gt11 clone into the high-copy-number plasmid pUC8. Escherichia coli containing these recombinants produced large amounts of the antigen, which was purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of urea. The ability of E. coli to recognize the mycobacterial promoter was confirmed by constructing additional clones in which the gene is flanked by transcriptional terminators from phage fd. A similar approach was used to demonstrate the expression of this gene in Streptomyces lividans. Mice immunized with killed M. leprae showed cell-mediated immune reactivity to the purified 65-kilodalton protein which stimulated both in vitro lymphoproliferative and in vivo delayed-type hypersensitivity responses.",1988
s79445,antigenic variation among group a streptococcal m proteins. nucleotide sequence of the serotype 5 m protein gene and its relationship with genes encoding types 6 and 24 m proteins.,"antigenic variation among group a streptococcal m proteins. nucleotide sequence of the serotype 5 m protein gene and its relationship with genes encoding types 6 and 24 m proteins.. The 1479-base pair (bp) nucleotide sequence of the serotype 5 M protein gene (smp5) from Streptococcus pyogenes contains three distinct types of tandemly repeated sequences, designated A, B, and C. Repeat A (21 bp x 6, in the 5'-half of smp5), shares no homology with the types 6 or 24 M protein genes (Hollingshead, S. K., Fischetti, V. A., and Scott, J. R. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 1677-1686; Mouw, A. R., Beachey, E. H., and Burdett, V. (1988) J. Bacteriol., in press). Repeat B (75 bp x 3.6, in the center of smp5) is also present in the M6, but not in the M24 gene. Repeat C (105 bp x 2.7, just distal to the B repeats) shares homology with repeats in both the M6 and M24 genes. All three genes share extensive homology in their 3'-halves and in 5' sequences encoding the N-terminal signal peptides, but between these two regions there are highly variable sequences that are responsible for antigenic diversity. These relationships suggest that both intergenic and intragenic recombination has occurred during the evolution of distinct M protein serotypes. All three M proteins contain conserved hydrophobic and proline-rich sequences at their C-terminal ends, suggestive of a membrane anchor and a peptidoglycan spanning region.",1988
s79515,a vaccine candidate from the sexual stage of human malaria that contains egf-like domains.,"a vaccine candidate from the sexual stage of human malaria that contains egf-like domains.. Malaria vaccines are being developed against different stages in the parasite's life cycle, each increasing the opportunity to control malaria in its diverse settings. Sporozoite vaccines are designed to prevent mosquito-induced infection; first generation recombinant or synthetic peptide vaccines have been tested in humans. Asexual erythrocytic stage vaccines, developed to prevent or reduce the severity of disease, have been tested in animals and in humans. A third strategy is to produce sexual stage vaccines that would induce antibodies which would prevent infection of mosquitoes when ingested in a bloodmeal containing sexual stage parasites. Although not directly protective, the sexual stage vaccine combined with a sporozoite or asexual stage vaccine (protective component) could prolong the useful life of the protective component by reducing transmission of resistant vaccine-induced mutants. In areas of low endemnicity, the sexual stage vaccine could reduce transmission below the critical threshold required to maintain the infected population, thereby assisting in the control or eradication of malaria. Transmission of Plasmodium falciparum, the major human malaria, can be blocked by monoclonal antibodies against three sexual stage-specific antigens. We have cloned the gene encoding the surface protein of relative molecular mass Mr 25,000 (25K; Pfs25), expressed on zygotes and ookinetes of P. falciparum. The deduced amino-acid sequence consists of a signal sequence, a hydrophobic C-terminus, and four tandem epidermal growth factor EGF-like domains.",1988
s79550,ectopic expression of the y (ley) antigen defined by monoclonal antibody 12-4le in distal colonic adenocarcinomas.,"ectopic expression of the y (ley) antigen defined by monoclonal antibody 12-4le in distal colonic adenocarcinomas.. Monoclonal antibody (MAb) 12-4LE reacts specifically with the alpha Fuc(1-2) beta Gal(1-4) [alpha Fuc(1-3)]GlcNAc-R synthetic oligosaccharide and consequently characterizes the Y (Ley) antigen. In normal individuals, this MAb reacts more strongly on samples from blood group O persons, indicating that the Y structure is better recognized when terminal A or B sugars are not added to the Y structure. In fetal and normal adult gastrointestinal tract, this antibody reacts with the epithelium of stomach, small intestine and proximal colon, but not of distal colon. In the adult, cells from the surface epithelium of the gastric, small intestinal and cecal mucosae express the Y antigen according to the secretor phenotype of each individual, thus characterizing the so-called """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""upward differentiation"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" pattern.

Proximal fetal colonic mucosa has the same genetic control as the downward differentiation pattern of the adult. Distal fetal colonic mucosa is negative with anti-Y, as in the adult. Y antigen was not expressed in hyperplastic (10 cases), juvenile (5 cases) or adenomatous (43 cases) polyps, except for some spreading villous adenomas in which rare Y-positive foci could be observed but which were not specifically associated with dysplastic glands. Polyps from familiar polyposis did not express this antigen. In adenocarcinomas, the Y antigen was expressed in 41/45 (91%) of distal tumors and 15/35 (43%) of cecal tumors, independently of ABO phenotype. The ectopic expression of this Y antigen on distal colon adenocarcinomas may be a useful tool in the detection of distal colonic carcinomas.",1988
s79649,role for intracellular proteases in the processing and transport of class ii hla antigens.,"role for intracellular proteases in the processing and transport of class ii hla antigens.. Human B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCL) incubated with the protease inhibitor leupeptin accumulate complexes of class II HLA antigens with a series of Mr 21,000-23,000 basic proteins termed leupeptin-induced proteins (LIP). The appearance of class II antigen-associated LIP coincides with the disappearance of class II antigen-associated invariant (I) chain. Glycopeptides generated by in vitro proteolysis of LIP and I chain using Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease are identical as determined by electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. These results suggest that LIP is a proteolytic product derived from the I chain and are consistent with the view that further in vivo proteolysis of LIP by a leupeptin-sensitive enzyme normally facilitates its release from class II antigens. Incubation of B-LCL with monensin, which traps class II antigens and associated I chain in the Golgi apparatus, or chloroquine, which neutralizes intracellular acidic compartments and inhibits I-chain dissociation, blocks the leupeptin-induced appearance of LIP. Treatment of LIP with endoglycosidases F and H shows that both of its N-linked oligosaccharides are in the complex form, indicating that proteolysis of class II antigen-associated I chain to generate LIP occurs in a late-Golgi or post-Golgi compartment. The compartment in which these proteolytic events occur may be identical to the site in macrophages and B lymphocytes where foreign antigens are processed and interact with class II HLA molecules.",1988
s79781,analysis and genetic manipulation of shigella virulence determinants for vaccine development.,"analysis and genetic manipulation of shigella virulence determinants for vaccine development.. Shigellosis is a major public health problem in developing countries. Current epidemics of Shigella dysenteriae serotype 1 strains are particularly serious and are characterized by high mortality rates. A high proportion of the isolates are resistant to many of the antibiotics currently in use in these countries, a feature which seriously compromises clinical treatment of the infections. Efficacious vaccines are thus urgently needed. Basic studies on Shigella virulence factors, infections in laboratory models, and host responses has led to the development of several strategies for the production of vaccines. All of these are live oral vaccines involving bacteria capable of at least limited survival in the animal intestine and of carrying selected antigens to the mucosal immune system. One type of vaccine involves non-pathogenic shigellae, attenuated either by introduction of a requirement for aromatic amino acids (aroD) or by loss of the large plasmid that specifies bacterial invasion of the mucosal epithelium. S. dysenteriae 1 strains under development as vaccines need to be engineered to eliminate high level Shiga toxin production, and a rapid and effective method to achieve this was recently elaborated. The second type of vaccine is represented by hybrid strains consisting of a carrier organism, such as an attenuated Salmonella or an Escherichia coli K-12 strain carrying the Shigella invasion plasmid, and the selected foreign antigen that it produces, in all cases so far the Shigella O antigen polysaccharide.",1988
s79783,avirulent salmonella typhimurium delta cya delta crp oral vaccine strains expressing a streptococcal colonization and virulence antigen.,"avirulent salmonella typhimurium delta cya delta crp oral vaccine strains expressing a streptococcal colonization and virulence antigen.. Salmonella typhimurium SR-11 strains lacking adenylate cyclase and the cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) due to deletion (delta) mutations in the cya and crp genes, respectively, are avirulent for mice and induce high level protective immunity against subsequent challenge with wild-type virulent S. typhimurium SR-11 cells. The avirulence of these delta cya delta crp mutants has been enhanced by elimination of the 100 kb virulence plasmid pStSR100 without impairing immunogenicity. The present report confirms the avirulence and immunogenicity of these mutant strains, demonstrates that immunization of both four- and eight-week-old mice has no adverse effect on weight gain, and that immunity lasts at least ninety days following initial immunization. Avirulent S. typhimurium strains have been endowed with the ability to produce several streptococcal colonization and virulence antigens for the purpose of constructing recombinant bivalent oral vaccine strains. Important antigenic determinants of the Streptococcus sobrinus surface protein antigen A (SpaA), presumed to be a critical colonization antigen of S. sobrinus, are expressed at high level by the delta cya delta crp S. typhimurium strains. The recombinant vaccine strains are stable in vitro and in animals (for a period of at least eight days) where they localize to the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).",1988
s79834,development and testing of aids vaccines.,"development and testing of aids vaccines.. Recent advances in delineating the molecular biology of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) have led to innovative approaches to development of a vaccine for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). However, the lack of understanding of mechanisms of protective immunity against HIV-1, the magnitude of genetic variation of the virus, and the lack of effective animal models for HIV-1 infection and AIDS have impeded progress. The testing of AIDS vaccines also presents challenges. These include liability concerns over vaccine-related injuries; identification of suitable populations for phase 3 efficacy studies; balancing the ethical obligation to counsel research subjects to avoid high-risk behavior with the necessity to obtain vaccine efficacy data; and the effect of vaccine-induced seroconversion on the recruiting and welfare of trial volunteers. Several candidate AIDS vaccines are nevertheless currently under development, and some are undergoing phase 1 clinical trials. Rapid progress will depend on continued scientific advancement in conjunction with maximum use of resources, open information and reagent exchange, and a spirit of international collaboration.",1988
s79908,processing of the precursor to the major merozoite surface antigens of plasmodium falciparum.,"processing of the precursor to the major merozoite surface antigens of plasmodium falciparum.. Specific sequences derived from the gene for the precursor to the major merozoite surface antigens (PMMSA) of Plasmodium falciparum have been expressed in Escherichia coli and the products have been used to produce antibodies. These antibodies, together with monoclonal antibodies, have been used to investigate the form of the PMMSA protein associated with merozoites. Polypeptide fragments derived by processing from the PMMSA protein have been detected in extracts of merozoites and assigned to locations within the PMMSA coding sequence.",1987
s80057,antigenicity and immunogenicity of domains of the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) envelope polypeptide expressed in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"antigenicity and immunogenicity of domains of the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) envelope polypeptide expressed in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.. Expression vectors were constructed for the production of various domains of the envelope gene product of the SF-2 isolate of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Serum specimens from HIV seropositive blood donors reacted in immunoblot assays with recombinant polypeptides from both the gp120 and gp41 coding regions of env. Polypeptides from both domains were purified and injected into experimental animals. Antibodies raised in rabbits to env-2, a recombinant polypeptide representing the majority of the protein moiety of gp120, reacted with fully glycosylated native gp120 of HIV-SF2 virions. In addition, these env-2 antisera showed reactivity with viral gp120 of divergent HIV isolates. A 121 amino acid polypeptide (env-5), representing the region of gp41 stretching between the two hydrophobic domains of the protein, elicited antibodies in rabbits that reacted with glycosylated, native gp41. Thus, selected domains of the HIV env gene expressed in genetically engineered yeast, are recognized by sera from HIV infected humans, elicit antibodies that react with native HIV glycoproteins and provide a source of envelope antigens for evaluation as potential subunit vaccines for HIV.",1987
s80088,crosses of two independently derived transgenic mice demonstrate functional complementation of the genes encoding heavy (hla-b27) and light (beta 2-microglobulin) chains of hla class i antigens.,"crosses of two independently derived transgenic mice demonstrate functional complementation of the genes encoding heavy (hla-b27) and light (beta 2-microglobulin) chains of hla class i antigens.. In man a number of diseases are associated with certain alleles of MHC antigens. The most pronounced example is ankylosing spondylitis, which is strongly associated with HLA-B27. As a first step towards a model system to study the basis of this association, transgenic mice were generated that showed cell surface expression of the HLA-B27 antigen biochemically indistinguishable from HLA-B27 antigen expressed on human cells. This result was obtained by crossing two independently derived strains of mice, one of which is transgenic for the HLA-B27 heavy chain gene, and the other carrying and expressing the human beta 2m gene. Examination of HLA-B27 and human beta 2m mRNA in various tissues shows the two genes to be expressed in a coordinate fashion. The mRNA levels follow those of endogenous H-2 Class I genes.",1987
s80245,a liver-stage-specific antigen of plasmodium falciparum characterized by gene cloning.,"a liver-stage-specific antigen of plasmodium falciparum characterized by gene cloning.. The liver phase of development of malaria parasites has been studied only recently and remains poorly understood compared to the other stages such as sporozoites, merozoites and gametes. Access to liver forms of Plasmodium falciparum has been improved by the development of in vivo and in vitro propagation methods, but the yield of mature schizonts remains limited and does not allow a detailed antigenic analysis. To date, only immunofluorescence assays (IFA) have permitted a description of a species and liver-stage-specific antigen(s) (LSA; ref. 3). Monospecific antibodies to these antigens have not been obtained due either to difficulty in immunizing mice (against LSA), or to poor stability of human monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, as a means of characterizing the LSA, we used an alternative immunological approach to identify clones of the corresponding LSA genes. We describe here the isolation of a DNA sequence coding for a P. falciparum liver-stage-specific antigen composed of repeats of 17 amino-acids, which is immunogenic in man.",1987
s80324,primary structure of lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 (lfa-3). the ligand of the t lymphocyte cd2 glycoprotein.,"primary structure of lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 (lfa-3). the ligand of the t lymphocyte cd2 glycoprotein.. We have isolated the cDNA for human lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 (LFA-3), the ligand of the T lymphocyte CD2 molecule. The identity of the clones was established by comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence to the LFA-3 NH2-terminal and tryptic peptide sequences. The cDNA defines a mature protein of 222 amino acids that structurally resembles typical membrane-anchored proteins. An extracellular domain with six N-linked glycosylation sites is followed by a hydrophobic putative transmembrane region and a short cytoplasmic domain. The mature glycoprotein is estimated to be 44-68% carbohydrate. Southern blots of human genomic DNA indicate that only one gene codes for human LFA-3. Northern blot analysis demonstrates that the LFA-3 mRNA of 1.3 kb is widely distributed in human tissues and cell lines.",1987
s80417,introduction of shigella flexneri 2a type and group antigen genes into oral typhoid vaccine strain salmonella typhi ty21a.,"introduction of shigella flexneri 2a type and group antigen genes into oral typhoid vaccine strain salmonella typhi ty21a.. For protection against dysentery caused by Shigella flexneri 2a, an in vivo-constructed recombinant plasmid with genes specifying the S. flexneri type and group antigens located near the pro (min 6) and his (min 44) chromosomal markers, respectively, was made and transferred to the galE Salmonella typhi strain Ty21a. Strain Ty21a carrying this recombinant plasmid was shown by immunological and biochemical analyses to express the S. flexneri 2a type and group antigens. Mice immunized with this vaccine strain were found to be protected against challenge with virulent S. flexneri 2a, but not significantly against S. typhi challenge, presumably because synthesis of the Shigella antigens interfered with expression of the typhoid antigens. Elimination of the recombinant plasmid from Ty21a allowed this strain to again express typical S. typhi O antigens. Mouse protection against both S. typhi and S. flexneri 2a challenges was achieved with a whole-cell vaccine mixture composed of equal parts of Ty21a and the Ty21a-S. flexneri 2a hybrid strain.",1987
s80437,secretion of particles of hepatitis b surface antigen from insect cells using a baculovirus vector.,secretion of particles of hepatitis b surface antigen from insect cells using a baculovirus vector.. The coding sequences of the hepatitis B virus surface antigen were inserted into a baculovirus transfer vector produced from Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) so that the foreign gene was under the control of the AcNPV polyhedrin promoter. Spodoptera frugiperda cells infected with the derived recombinant baculovirus produced and secreted 22 nm particles containing the hepatitis B surface antigen. The particles had morphological and antigenic properties identical to those of 22 nm particles isolated from the plasma of chronic active hepatitis patients.,1987
s80440,expression of hepatitis b virus middle and large surface antigen genes in saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"expression of hepatitis b virus middle and large surface antigen genes in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. The hepatitis B virus genome carries the surface antigen (SAg) gene and an open reading frame that encodes two SAg-related polypeptides: SAg with a 55-amino-acid N-terminal extension polypeptide and SAg with a 174-amino-acid N-terminal extension polypeptide. These are termed middle S and large S, respectively. These polypeptides or their glycosylated derivatives have been detected in Dane particles, but their chemical and biological properties have remained largely unknown because of their limited availability. We attempted to produce these proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by placing the coding regions under the control of the promoter of the yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene. Yeast cells carrying middle S and large S coding sequences produced 33,000- and 42,000-dalton products, respectively, each of which reacted with anti-S antibody and bound to polymerized human serum albumin, in accordance with the known properties of pre-S proteins from particles in human sera (K. H. Heermann, U. Goldmann, W. Schwartz, T. Seyffarth, H. Baumgarten, and W. H. Gerlich, J. Virol. 52:396-402, 1984; A. Machida, S. Kishimoto, H. Ohnuma, K. Baba, Y. Ito, H. Miyamoto, G. Funatsu, K. Oda, S. Usuda, S. Togami, T. Nakamura, Y. Miyakawa, and M. Mayumi, Gastroenterology 86:910-918, 1984). The middle S polypeptide is glycosylated and can be assembled into particles whose size and density are similar to those of SAg. However, this polypeptide was highly susceptible to proteolytic degradation into 29,000- and 26,000-dalton polypeptides, of which only the former retained the binding activity to polymerized albumin. The large S polypeptides are nonglycosylated, relatively stable, and do not seem to assemble into particles by themselves.",1987
s80475,differential expression of glial- and neuronal-associated antigens in human tumors of the central and peripheral nervous system.,"differential expression of glial- and neuronal-associated antigens in human tumors of the central and peripheral nervous system.. The immunoreactivity of a panel of poly- and monoclonal antibodies raised against different glial and neuronal antigens was investigated in paraffin-embedded specimens of 116 human tumors of the central and peripheral nervous system. We used antibodies against the HNK-1 epitope, which is shared between natural killer cells and the nervous system, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), vimentin, neurofilaments, S-100 protein, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and myelin basic protein (MBP). HNK-1 immunoreactivity was detectable in nearly all neuroectodermal tumors. Especially in those derived from the neuroepithelium, which include the various types of gliomas, we observed a strong staining with this antibody. The only exceptions were the choroid plexus papillomas and individual ependymomas. In tumors derived from the neural crest HNK-1 reactivity was more variable and less intense. In other tumors of the nervous system HNK-1 was not detectable, except for two out of four malignant lymphomas. In addition to its reactivity with human lymphocytes HNK-1, therefore, seems to be a useful 'marker' for neurogenic tumors in general. GFAP expression was prominent in all astrocytomas and the astrocytic cells within mixed gliomas and gangliogliomas. Immunoreactivity was more variable in glioblastomas and ependymomas, while only isolated GFAP-positive cells were present in oligodendrogliomas, medulloblastomas, one plexus papilloma, and some neurinomas. Vimentin immunoreactivity was found in tumor cells of nearly all tumors of the central nervous system with the exception of oligodendrogliomas, most plexus papillomas, neuronal tumors and most medulloblastomas.",1987
s80580,construction and characterization of a saccharomyces cerevisiae strain (rit4376) expressing hepatitis b surface antigen.,construction and characterization of a saccharomyces cerevisiae strain (rit4376) expressing hepatitis b surface antigen.. A host/vector system suitable for large-scale production of HBsAg has been constructed and optimized in terms of the expression plasmid and yeast host strain in order to permit fermentation to very high cell densities. The final expression plasmid contains the coding sequence of the major HBsAg protein (P24) flanked by the promoter sequences from a glycolytic gene and by the transcription-termination region of the ARG3 gene. The host/vector system was found to be genetically stable under large-scale fermentation conditions as demonstrated by nucleotide sequencing and restriction mapping experiments. The P24 protein is recovered from yeast as particles whose physiochemical properties are very similar to those of plasma-derived HBsAg.,1987
s80853,a naturally occurring gene encoding the major surface antigen precursor p190 of plasmodium falciparum lacks tripeptide repeats.,"a naturally occurring gene encoding the major surface antigen precursor p190 of plasmodium falciparum lacks tripeptide repeats.. Plasmodium falciparum merozoites have variable surface proteins that are processed from a 190-kd precursor protein (p190). The gene encoding p190 exists in two allelic forms and cross-over events occurring mainly near the 5' end, combined with isolate-specific tripeptide repeats, contribute to its antigen diversity. We have sequenced a large portion of the p190 gene from the parasite isolate RO-33 (Ghana). Remarkably, the typical N-terminal tripeptide repeat structure is lacking. Apart from mutations in the variable parts, the gene appears identical to the MAD-20 allele (Papua, New Guinea). Southern blot analysis detects p190 genes similar to RO-33 in other parasite isolates independent of their geographical origin. The lack of p190 repeats in RO-33 eliminates the possibility that they are involved in host cell recognition or integration and restricts their function to immune escape.",1987
s81034,four viral genes independently contribute to attenuation of live influenza a/ann arbor/6/60 (h2n2) cold-adapted reassortant virus vaccines.,"four viral genes independently contribute to attenuation of live influenza a/ann arbor/6/60 (h2n2) cold-adapted reassortant virus vaccines.. Clinical studies previously demonstrated that live influenza A virus vaccines derived by genetic reassortment from the mating of influenza A/Ann Arbor/6/60 (H2N2) cold-adapted (ca) donor virus with epidemic wild-type influenza A viruses are reproducibly safe, infectious, immunogenic, and efficacious in the prevention of illness caused by challenge with virulent wild-type virus. These influenza A reassortant virus vaccines also express the ca and temperature sensitivity (ts) phenotypes in vitro, but the genes of the ca virus parent which specify the ca, ts, and attenuation (att) phenotypes have not adequately been defined. To identify the genes associated with each of these phenotypes, we isolated six single-gene substitution reassortant viruses, each of which inherited only one RNA segment from the ca parent virus and the remaining seven RNA segments from the A/Korea/1/82 (H3N2) wild-type virus parent. These were evaluated in vitro for their ca and ts phenotypes and in ferrets, hamsters, and seronegative adult volunteers for the att phenotype. We found that the polymerase PA gene of the ca parent specifies the ca phenotype and that the PB2 and PB1 genes independently specify the ts phenotype. The PA, M, PB2, and PB1 genes of the ca donor virus each contribute to the att phenotype. The finding that four genes of the ca donor virus contribute to the att phenotype provides a partial explanation for the observed phenotypic stability of ca reassortant viruses following replication in humans.",1988
s81158,a heat shock operon in coxiella burnetti produces a major antigen homologous to a protein in both mycobacteria and escherichia coli.,"a heat shock operon in coxiella burnetti produces a major antigen homologous to a protein in both mycobacteria and escherichia coli.. A gene library from the DNA of Coxiella burnetii has been constructed in the cosmid vector pHC79. A particular clone, pJB196, reacted strongly with Coxiella-specific antibodies elicited in a number of different species of animals. This clone produced two abundant C. burnetii-specific polypeptides, a 14-kilodalton nonimmunoreactive protein and a 62-kilodalton immunoreactive protein. Sequencing identified two open reading frames, encoding polypeptides of 10.5 and 58.3 kilodaltons. The only transcriptional control element observed on the 5' side of the initiation codon resembled a heat shock promoter. This heat shock promoter was functionally regulated in Escherichia coli, since both proteins were produced by growth conditions at 37 degrees C and neither protein was detected at 23 degrees C. There were four sequences from the literature that were highly homologous (greater than 50%) to the 62-kilodalton protein from C. burnetii. Three were from Mycobacterium species and represent the immunodominant antigen of this genus. The other was from E. coli, detected as a gene that complements or suppresses a temperature-sensitive RNase activity. Since the recombinant protein was immunogenic, it may serve as an efficacious vaccine against C. burnetii and other pathogenic microorganisms that express the conserved antigen.",1988
s81220,a new model of autoimmune disease. experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis induced in mice with two different retinal antigens.,"a new model of autoimmune disease. experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis induced in mice with two different retinal antigens.. Experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) is an organ-specific, T lymphocyte-mediated autoimmune disease, which serves as a model for several human ocular inflammations of an apparently autoimmune nature. EAU pathology in some rodents and in monkeys can readily be induced by immunization with several different retinal proteins; however, advancing research into the cellular mechanisms of this disease has raised the need for an EAU model in an immunologically and genetically well defined species. We report here the induction of EAU in the mouse, which has hitherto been considered a species refractory to EAU, with two retinal Ag, the retinal soluble Ag and the interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein. Although all the mouse strains tested exhibited lymphocyte responses and antibody titers to both retinal Ag, EAU was inducible in only some of the strains, and the uveitogenic responses to retinal soluble Ag and interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein appeared to be mutually exclusive. The EAU model in mice was found to differ in several respects from the EAU model in other rodent species. Induction of the disease was achieved with a relatively high dose of Ag and an intensified immunization protocol, and the onset of disease was later, the duration was longer, and the course was less acute. Anterior segment involvement was slight or nonexistent, and damage to the retina and uvea was of a focal rather than of a diffuse nature. Murine EAU appeared to approximate some types of human uveitis more closely than the EAU models described in other rodent species with respect to its pathologic manifestations as well as its more chronic course. The relatively longer duration of the active stage of disease in murine EAU should facilitate therapeutic intervention in established disease, which was not feasible in the more acute models of EAU. The extensive knowledge of the immunologic parameters of the mouse and the availability of genetically defined strains should be of great value in the study of cellular mechanisms and immunogenetics of ocular autoimmune disease.",1988
s81224,molecular cloning of the major surface antigen of leishmania.,"molecular cloning of the major surface antigen of leishmania.. The gene encoding gp63, the major surface glycoprotein of Leishmania promastigotes, was isolated from Leishmania major using a synthetic oligonucleotide probe based on the NH2-terminal protein sequence of purified gp63. DNA sequence analysis and the translated amino acid sequence indicate that gp63 is synthesized as precursor molecule having both an NH2-terminal preregion (signal peptide) and an adjacent proregion. This structure is consistent with the protease activity of gp63 since many other proteases are synthesized as precursor forms requiring processing for enzymatic activity. Hybridization studies demonstrated that there are multiple copies of the gp63 gene in the genome of L. major and other Leishmania species. The conservation of the coding sequence of gp63 amongst diverse species of Leishmania provides further support for the importance of gp63 during the life cycle of Leishmania.",1988
s81339,formation of transmembraneous hepatitis b e-antigen by cotranslational in vitro processing of the viral precore protein.,"formation of transmembraneous hepatitis b e-antigen by cotranslational in vitro processing of the viral precore protein.. The gene encoding the major core protein P22c of hepatitis B virus is preceded by a precore sequence. Expression of the core gene with the precore in Escherichia coli results in a membrane protein of HBe antigenicity. Expression in mammalian cells generates secreted HBeAg. To study the biosynthetic pathway of HBeAg and the function of precore in this process, we translated mRNAs for core proteins with and without precore using reticulocyte lysates and microsomal vesicles. The precore sequence was cleaved cotranslationally as a signal peptide, probably at alanine 19. The processed product P23e was partially translocated to the lumen of the microsomes. The arginine-rich carboxy-terminal domain of P23e was however not translocated and susceptible to trypsin. Clusters of positive-charged amino acids seem to act as a novel type of translocation stop signal. Trypsin generated a P16e which no longer had a transmembraneous configuration. The findings may explain the biosynthesis and potential function of HBeAg in hepatitis B virus-infected hepatocytes.",1988
s81378,a gale via (vi antigen-negative) mutant of salmonella typhi ty2 retains virulence in humans.,"a gale via (vi antigen-negative) mutant of salmonella typhi ty2 retains virulence in humans.. We have recently described the construction of a galE derivative of Salmonella typhi Ty2 (Ty2H1) which had a 0.4-kilobase deletion in the galE gene and was sensitive to galactose-induced lysis when cultured with greater than or equal to 0.06 mM galactose (D. M. Hone, R. Morona, S. Attridge, and J. Hackett, J. Infect. Dis. 156:167-174, 1987). We now report the selection of a rifampin-resistant, via derivative of Ty2H1, EX462. Compared with the Ty2 parent strain, EX462 was serum sensitive and highly attenuated in the mouse mucin virulence assay. When four human volunteers ingested 7 X 10(8) viable EX462, two became ill and developed a typhoidlike disease with fever and bacteremia. Blood isolates from these individuals were indistinguishable from the vaccine strain by a variety of criteria. We concluded that, even in a via background, the galE mutation was not attenuating for S. typhi in humans.",1988
s81512,molecular cloning and characterization of an antigen associated with early stages of melanoma tumor progression.,"molecular cloning and characterization of an antigen associated with early stages of melanoma tumor progression.. The melanoma-associated antigen ME491 is expressed strongly during the early stages of tumor progression. The ME491 gene was molecularly cloned by means of DNA-mediated gene transfer followed by screening a lambda genomic library with human repetitive Alu sequences as a probe. The cloned DNA, after transfection into mouse L-cells, generated a protein with characteristics that were indistinguishable in Western blot analysis from the ME491 antigen expressed by human melanoma cells. Repeat-free subfragments of the cloned DNA were used for further studies. By Northern blot analysis, the subfragments detected a single 1.2-kilobase mRNA in the transformants and various human melanoma cell lines. ME491 complementary DNA clones were then obtained by probing a melanoma complementary DNA library with the genomic subfragments. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cloned complementary DNA indicated that the ME491 antigen consists of 237 amino acids (Mr 25,475) with four transmembrane regions and three putative N-glycosylation sites. No significant structural homology was observed with other proteins thus far reported. We observed that the amounts of mRNA varied greatly with different melanoma cell lines. Southern blot analysis revealed no amplification or rearrangement of the ME491 gene in the human melanoma cell lines tested, including both high and low expressors of this antigen. The ME491 gene has been mapped to chromosome region 12p12----12q13 by somatic cell hybrid analysis and more narrowly localized to 12q12----12q14 by in situ hybridization.",1988
s82013,synthetic peptide vaccine design: synthesis and properties of a high-density multiple antigenic peptide system.,"synthetic peptide vaccine design: synthesis and properties of a high-density multiple antigenic peptide system.. A convenient and versatile approach to the direct synthesis of a peptide-antigen matrix by the solid-phase method is described. The approach is called the multiple antigen peptide system (MAP) and it utilizes a simple scaffolding of a low number of sequential levels (n) of a trifunctional amino acid as the core matrix and 2n peptide antigens to form a macromolecule with a high density of peptide antigens of final Mr 10,000. The MAP model chosen for study was an octa-branching MAP consisting of a core matrix made up of three levels of lysine and eight amino terminals for anchoring peptide antigens. The MAP, containing both the core matrix and peptides of 9-16 amino acids, was prepared in a single synthesis by the solid-phase method. Six different MAPs elicited specific antibodies in rabbits and mice, of which five produced antibodies that reacted with their corresponding native proteins. In rabbits, the sera had a considerably higher titer of antibodies than sera prepared from the same peptides anchored covalently to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as carrier. Thus, the MAP provided a general, but chemically unambiguous, approach for the preparation of carrier-bound antigens of predetermined and reproducible structure and might be suitable for generating vaccines.",1988
s82654,recombinant vaccinia viruses as live vaccines.,"recombinant vaccinia viruses as live vaccines.. Recombinant vaccinia viruses can be constructed that express foreign antigens. These viruses retain their infectivity and synthesise the foreign gene product in tissue culture and in vaccinated animals. Following vaccination, specific antibody and cell-mediated immune responses are generated against the foreign protein and in several cases these have protected the animal against subsequent challenge with the corresponding pathogen. The potential use of recombinant vaccinia viruses as medical or veterinary vaccines is discussed.",1987
s82861,specificity analysis of human monoclonal antibodies reactive with cell surface and intracellular antigens.,"specificity analysis of human monoclonal antibodies reactive with cell surface and intracellular antigens.. Over 4350 human Ig-secreting hybrids have been generated through the fusion of human lymphocytes with NS-1 (mouse), LICR-2, SKO-007, GM4672, or UC729-6 (human) myeloma and lymphoblastoid cell lines. NS-1 proved to be the most satisfactory fusion partner, and 83% of the stable Ig-secreting clones were derived from NS-1 fusions. Three hundred five hybrids produced human monoclonal antibodies (hmAb) reactive with cell surface or intracellular antigens expressed by cultured human tumor cell lines, and 111 of these have undergone detailed serological specificity analysis. Several general points have emerged from our study of hmAb: A significant proportion of the human B-cell clones produce antibody reactive with cellular antigens. The majority of these antigens have an intracellular location and are broadly distributed. Intracellular and cell surface differentiation antigens and other antigens with restricted distribution have been defined by hmAb, including two cell surface antigens not detected on normal cells. The relationship of these findings to cancer is unclear, as hmAb reactive with antigens showing distinctive distribution have been generated from the lymphocytes of normal individuals as well as tumor-bearing patients.",1986
s82909,use of hybridoma antibodies and recombinant dna technology in protozoan vaccine development.,"use of hybridoma antibodies and recombinant dna technology in protozoan vaccine development.. The use of hybridoma antibodies developed against the sporozoite stage of avian coccidia, coupled with genetic-engineering techniques, has made it possible to begin bird-immunization studies utilizing an Escherichia coli-elicited coccidial protein. The coccidia are currently controlled in the poultry industry by use of anticoccidial compounds, but it now may be possible to use the bird's own immune system for defense against the parasitic infection. Since the sporozoite stage, which initiates the infection in poultry, is quite complex and is made up of hundreds of proteins or antigens, hybridoma antibodies were produced to identify specific antigens. These antigens, once identified, were found in such minute amounts that it became necessary to utilize genetic engineering in order to produce enough protein for immunization studies. One such protein, designated 5401, has been shown to stimulate an antibody response in immunized birds and to impart partial protection against a coccidial challenge infection. The results of these studies indicate that development of a vaccine against coccidial parasites may someday be possible.",1986
s82987,oral immunization and protection of raccoons (procyon lotor) with a vaccinia-rabies glycoprotein recombinant virus vaccine.,"oral immunization and protection of raccoons (procyon lotor) with a vaccinia-rabies glycoprotein recombinant virus vaccine.. Animal rabies control has been frustrated by the existence of multiple wildlife reservoirs and the lack of efficacious oral vaccines. In this investigation, raccoons fed a vaccinia-rabies glycoprotein recombinant virus in a sponge bait developed rabies virus-neutralizing antibody (0.6-54.0 units) and resisted street rabies virus infection 28 and 205 days after feeding. Additional raccoons immunized by oral infusion with attenuated antigenic variants of rabies virus strains CVS-11 and ERA failed to develop rabies virus-neutralizing antibody. This work demonstrates the feasibility of a recombinant virus vaccine containing the rabies glycoprotein gene for immunization of raccoons, and possibly other wildlife, to obtain long-term protection against rabies.",1986
s83024,a synthetic peptide vaccine involving the product of the pre-s(2) region of hepatitis b virus dna: protective efficacy in chimpanzees.,"a synthetic peptide vaccine involving the product of the pre-s(2) region of hepatitis b virus dna: protective efficacy in chimpanzees.. The S gene encoding the major surface polypeptide of hepatitis B virus is preceded by the region pre-S(2) with a capacity to code for 55 amino acid residues. In the product of region pre-S(2), the sequence of 19 amino acid residues (amino acids 14-32 from the N terminus) representing an area of high local hydrophilicity is shared by viral strains of subtypes adr, ayw, and ayr; residue 22, phenylalanine, is replaced by leucine in a strain of the other subtype, adw. A synthetic peptide vaccine involving these 19 amino acid residues, when given to two chimpanzees, raised antibodies that bound to viral particles and protected the animals from challenge with 10(6) chimpanzee infectious doses of hepatitis B virus.",1986
s83142,adjuvant-free igg responses induced with antigen coupled to antibodies against class ii mhc.,"adjuvant-free igg responses induced with antigen coupled to antibodies against class ii mhc.. The generation of strong serological responses to protein antigens in experimental animals usually requires the use of potent adjuvants, most of which cannot be used in human or veterinary vaccines because of deleterious side effects. Attempting to circumvent this problem, we have assessed an adjuvant-free antigen-delivery system based on the hypothesis that antigen coupled to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) determinants should be 'targeted' onto antigen-presenting cells, thus facilitating recognition by helper T cells. We found that the biotin-binding protein avidin could generate a serological response in mice, without adjuvant, when injected coupled to a biotinylated anti-class II MHC mAb. Equivalent amounts of avidin mixed with the non-biotinylated form of the same mAb failed to elicit a response. A targeting effect was demonstrated at low levels of injected conjugate because only mice bearing the appropriate class II antigens responded. Responses were also seen with a protein antigen other than avidin, offering a new, adjuvant-free approach to subunit vaccine construction.",1987
s83420,differences in antigen presentation to mhc class i-and class ii-restricted influenza virus-specific cytolytic t lymphocyte clones.,"differences in antigen presentation to mhc class i-and class ii-restricted influenza virus-specific cytolytic t lymphocyte clones.. We have examined requirements for antigen presentation to a panel of MHC class I-and class II-restricted, influenza virus-specific CTL clones by controlling the form of virus presented on the target cell surface. Both H-2K/D- and I region-restricted CTL recognize target cells exposed to infectious virus, but only the I region-restricted clones efficiently lysed histocompatible target cells pulsed with inactivated virus preparations. The isolated influenza hemagglutinin (HA) polypeptide also could sensitize target cells for recognition by class II-restricted, HA-specific CTL, but not by class I-restricted, HA-specific CTL. Inhibition of nascent viral protein synthesis abrogated the ability of target cells to present viral antigen relevant for class I-restricted CTL recognition. Significantly, presentation for class II-restricted recognition was unaffected in target cells exposed to preparations of either inactivated or infectious virus. This differential sensitivity suggested that these H-2I region-restricted CTL recognized viral polypeptides derived from the exogenously introduced virions, rather than viral polypeptides newly synthesized in the infected cell. In support of this contention, treatment of the target cells with the lysosomotropic agent chloroquine abolished recognition of infected target cells by class II-restricted CTL without diminishing class I-restricted recognition of infected target cells. Furthermore, when the influenza HA gene was introduced into target cells without exogenous HA polypeptide, the target cells that expressed the newly synthesized protein product of the HA gene were recognized only by H-2K/D-restricted CTL. These observations suggest that important differences may exist in requirements for antigen presentation between H-2K/D and H-2I region-restricted CTL. These differences may reflect the nature of the antigenic epitopes recognized by these two CTL subsets.",1986
s83481,"structure, sequence, and polymorphism of the lyt-2 t cell differentiation antigen gene.","structure, sequence, and polymorphism of the lyt-2 t cell differentiation antigen gene.. We have determined the nucleotide sequence and genomic organization of the mouse Lyt-2 T lymphocyte differentiation antigen gene. This gene consists of five exons and four introns, and the organization roughly parallels the protein domains. Alternative splicing to include or exclude exon IV (encoding part of the cytoplasmic tail) results in two forms of mRNA and accounts for the difference in size between the alpha- and alpha'-chains of Lyt-2. The gene structure provides further evidence for the evolutionary relationship between Lyt-2 and immunoglobulin genes. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the Lyt-2.1 and Lyt-2.2 alleles shows a high degree of conservation, but indicates that a single nucleotide change and consequent amino acid substitution in the variable region-like domain accounts for the serologic difference between these two alleles.",1986
s83538,antigen-specific lyt-2+ cytolytic t lymphocytes from mice infected with the intracellular bacterium listeria monocytogenes.,"antigen-specific lyt-2+ cytolytic t lymphocytes from mice infected with the intracellular bacterium listeria monocytogenes.. In vitro expanded T cell lines were used to determine whether antigen-specific cytolytic T lymphocytes are generated after infection with the intracellular bacterium, Listeria monocytogenes. Spleen cells from infected mice were cultured in the presence of syngeneic accessory cells, listerial antigen, and interleukin 2 containing supernatants. Cell lines were greater than 98% Thy-1+, L3T4-, Lyt-2+. Bone-marrow macrophages were used as target cells in two in vitro cytolytic assay systems. The Lyt-2+ T cells killed bone marrow macrophages only when infected with L. monocytogenes as assessed in a 4-hr 51Cr release assay and in an 18-hr neutral red uptake assay. Cytolysis was blocked by anti-LFA-1 and anti-Lyt-2 monoclonal antibodies. These cytolytic T cells produced interferon-gamma after co-stimulation with antigen, accessory cells, and recombinant interleukin 2. Bone marrow macrophages infected with Mycobacterium bovis were not killed by T cells from L. monocytogenes-infected mice but by T cell lines from M. bovis-infected mice, indicating that cytolysis was antigen specific. L. monocytogenes-infected target cells of different haplotype were lysed by the Lyt-2+ T cells. By using a low cell density split culture system, antigen-specific, H-2-restricted cytolytic T cells could be identified. These findings demonstrate that during infection with intracellular bacteria, Lyt-2+ T cells with cytolytic activity are generated that may be involved in antibacterial protection.",1986
s83546,immune responses to h-2kd antigen expressed by recombinant vaccinia virus.,"immune responses to h-2kd antigen expressed by recombinant vaccinia virus.. A recombinant vaccinia virus (VV-H2Kd-6) containing the coding sequence for the murine major histocompatibility complex class I antigen H-2Kd has been constructed and used to express H-2Kd on the surface of infected cells. Vaccinia expressed H-2Kd has been shown to generate an H-2Kd-specific primary cytotoxic T-cell response in mice infected with the recombinant virus and to stimulate an H-2Kd-specific cytotoxic T-cell response in vitro. Cells infected with the recombinant virus acted as targets for specific lysis by appropriate alloreactive cytotoxic T cells, albeit relatively inefficiently when compared with alloreactive recognition and specific lysis of H-2Kd-containing P815 cells. However, H-2Kd expressed by the recombinant virus was recognized efficiently as a restricting element in association with vaccinia virus antigens, while lysis of VV-H2Kd-6-infected L929 (H-2k) cells by CBA/H (H-2k) anti-C3H.OH (H-2KdDk) cytotoxic T cells was comparatively weak. These data suggest that there are quantitative or qualitative differences, or both, between H-2Kd expressed by vaccinia virus and cells of the H-2d haplotype. Qualitative differences have not been demonstrated but cannot be excluded.",1986
s83708,clinical importance of myeloid antigen expression in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"clinical importance of myeloid antigen expression in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia.. To determine the clinical importance of immunophenotypes in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we prospectively studied 76 patients with this condition. Before treatment, lymphoblasts were tested for reactivity with monoclonal antibodies to B-cell, T-cell, and myeloid (My) antigens. Unexpectedly, myeloid antigens (MCS-2 or MY9) were identified in 25 patients (33 percent), usually in conjunction with B-cell or T-cell antigens. Among My+ patients, 15 (60 percent) expressed B-cell antigens (B+T-My+); all 6 tested had rearranged immunoglobulin genes. Five patients (20 percent) expressed T-cell antigens (B-T+My+), and one My+ patient expressed both B-cell and T-cell antigens. Only myeloid antigens (B-T-My+) were expressed in four patients (16 percent); three who were tested had germ-line immunoglobulin and T-cell-receptor gene configurations. Although no significant differences in presenting clinical features were found, My+ patients had fewer complete remissions than My- patients (35 vs. 76 percent, P less than 0.01). No differences in response or survival were observed between My+ and My- patients expressing T-cell antigens. However, among those expressing B-cell antigens, My+ patients had fewer complete remissions (29 vs. 71 percent, P = 0.02) and shorter survival (P = 0.03; median, 8.1 vs. greater than 26 months). These findings indicate that expression of myeloid antigen identifies a high-risk group of patients with adult ALL for whom alternative forms of treatment should be investigated.",1987
s83871,adjuvant formulation for use in vaccines to elicit both cell-mediated and humoral immunity.,"adjuvant formulation for use in vaccines to elicit both cell-mediated and humoral immunity.. Adjuvant formulations which elicit both humoral and cell-mediated immunity will be required for vaccines based on peptides, viral and bacterial subunits and genetically engineered antigens. This report describes an adjuvant formulation which increases both cell-mediated and humoral immunity and is free of significant side effects encountered with other adjuvants or vehicles. The components include the threonyl analogue of muramyl dipeptide, Tween 80, Pluronic L121 and squalane. This formulation was found to be effective with several antigens, in several species, including rodents, cats and monkeys. These results suggest that the formulation will be useful for both human and veterinary vaccines.",1987
s84012,characterization of variable-region genes and shared crossreactive idiotypes of antibodies specific for antigens of various influenza viruses.,"characterization of variable-region genes and shared crossreactive idiotypes of antibodies specific for antigens of various influenza viruses.. Several syngeneic monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies were obtained against PY206, a monoclonal antibody specific for X-31 (H3N2) influenza virus hemagglutinin. This idiotype was found in the sera of BALB/c mice immunized with various influenza viruses. Adsorption experiments indicated that the PY206 Id was borne by antibodies specific for viral hemagglutinin (HA) and/or neuraminidase (NA). This idiotype was identified on other monoclonal antibodies specific for various influenza HAs (H3 and H1). Study of the variable-region (V) genes of these monoclonal antibodies showed that its expression is independent of variable kappa (VK)21 light-chains and that the heavy-chains of the strongly idiotype-positive hybridomas derive from either the variable heavy (VH) J558 or VH 7183 family. Finally, Western blot analysis demonstrated that PY206 idiotypic determinants are located exclusively on the heavy chain.",1987
s84015,cell-mediated immune responses to influenza virus antigens expressed by vaccinia virus recombinants.,"cell-mediated immune responses to influenza virus antigens expressed by vaccinia virus recombinants.. Recombinant vaccinia viruses enable studies of immune recognition of antigens expressed from single viral genes. We have constructed recombinants expressing the haemagglutinin (HA) and nucleoprotein (NP) genes of the influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1). These recombinant viruses together with a recombinant expressing the HA from influenza virus A/JAP/305/57 (H2N2) have been used to examine the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to these influenza virus antigens. Both antigens are recognised by murine CTL and recognition of HA is influenza virus subtype-specific, whereas recognition of NP is crossreactive. In limiting dilution studies approximately 10% of the influenza CTL response is HA-specific, while approximately 30% of the response is NP-specific. Despite the ability of NP to stimulate a significant CTL response, mice immunised with the NP-vaccinia recombinant are not as well protected from subsequent lethal challenge with influenza virus, as mice immunised with the HA vaccinia recombinant. These studies demonstrate that viral antigens expressed from vaccine recombinants can provide protective immunity and that the influenza-poxvirus recombinants can provide data on protective immunity generated by individual viral proteins.",1986
s84031,human t-cell clones recognize a major m. leprae protein antigen expressed in e. coli.,"human t-cell clones recognize a major m. leprae protein antigen expressed in e. coli.. Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. As with other intracellular parasites, protective immunity is dependent on T cells and cell-mediated immunity. In animal models, immunization with killed armadillo-derived M. leprae elicits strong T-cell responses, delayed-type hypersensitivity and protection against viable challenge. We have recently shown that killed M. leprae can induce delayed-type hypersensitivity in healthy human volunteers. Identification of the M. leprae antigens that are recognized by T cells and may be involved in protection has been hampered by the inability to cultivate the organism in vitro and by difficulties in antigen purification from limited quantities of armadillo-derived bacillus. Because genes for the major protein antigens of M. leprae as seen by mouse monoclonal antibodies have been isolated, it has become possible to test whether these individual antigens are recognized by T cells. We screened crude lambda gtll phage lysates of Escherichia coli containing individual M. leprae antigens using M. leprae-specific T-cell clones isolated from M. leprae-vaccinated volunteers. Using this method, we find that nearly half of the M. leprae-specific T-cell clones are stimulated to proliferate by lysates containing an epitope of a M. leprae protein of relative molecular mass 18,000 (18K).",1986
s84054,"plasmids coding for colonization factor antigens i and ii, heat-labile enterotoxin, and heat-stable enterotoxin a2 in escherichia coli.","plasmids coding for colonization factor antigens i and ii, heat-labile enterotoxin, and heat-stable enterotoxin a2 in escherichia coli.. Colonization factor antigens I and II (CFA/I and CFA/II) are important in the pathogenesis of diarrhea in humans caused by some enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). Plasmid DNA from 16 CFA/I+ and five CFA/II+ ETEC were examined by Southern blot analysis with enterotoxin gene probes and were compared with plasmid DNA from derivatives of the same ETEC that had lost the ability to produce these colonization factors. Among the 16 CFA/I+ ETEC strains, the loss of CFA/I was accompanied by the loss of a plasmid of between 34 and 68 megadaltons (MDa) coding for heat-stable enterotoxin A2 (ST-A2) in 12 strains, by the loss of a 60-MDa plasmid coding for heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) and ST-A2 in one strain, or by deletions of a segment of DNA encoding for ST-A2 in three strains. Among five CFA/II+ ETEC strains, the loss of CFA/II was associated with the loss of a plasmid of 75 MDa coding for LT and ST-A2 in three strains, with the loss of genes coding for LT and ST-A2 from a 68-MDa plasmid in one strain, or with no discernible loss of a plasmid or DNA sequences coding for enterotoxins in the remaining strain. The loss of CFA/I and CFA/II production was associated with the loss of DNA sequences encoding for ST-A2 in 20 of 21 ETEC examined.",1986

A recombinant 64 kD protein of Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) (antigen A), which amounted to approximately 2% of an E. coli lysate, was tested for its capacity to stimulate human T4 clones reactive to mycobacterial proteins. Two out of four crossreactive clones, established from a patient with tuberculoid leprosy, which could be stimulated by protein preparations of M. leprae and M. tuberculosis, and by particulate M. bovis BCG were also reactive to antigen A without further enrichment from E. coli lysate. In addition, BCG-reactive T cell clones from two of three healthy PPD+ donors reacted with antigen A. This finding shows that human T cell clones may be useful for probing gene-cloned proteins of potential value for vaccination against diseases where protection is mediated exclusively by T cells.",1986

Murine monoclonal antibody B72.3, prepared against a membrane-enriched extract of human metastatic carcinoma, was reacted with a spectrum of adult and fetal human tissues using avidin-biotin-complex immunohistochemical techniques to evaluate the expression of the reactive tumor associated glycoprotein (TAG)-72 antigen. TAG-72 was shown to be expressed in several epithelial-derived cancers including 94% of colonic adenocarcinomas, 84% of invasive ductal carcinomas of the breast, 96% of non-small cell lung carcinomas, 100% of common epithelial ovarian carcinomas, as well as the majority of pancreatic, gastric, and esophageal cancers evaluated.

Appreciable monoclonal antibody B72.3 reactivity was generally not observed in adult normal tissues, with limited reactivity noted in a few benign lesions of the breast and colon. TAG-72 antigen expression was detected, however, in fetal colon, stomach, and esophagus, thus defining TAG-72 as an oncofetal antigen. TAG-72 has previously been shown to be distinct from carcinoembryonic antigen and other tumor associated antigens. The pancarcinoma distribution and lack of significant reactivity with normal adult tissues of monoclonal antibody B72.3 suggest its potential diagnostic and therapeutic utility for human carcinomas.",1986
s84237,plaque antibody selection: rapid immunological analysis of a large number of recombinant phage clones positive to sera raised against plasmodium falciparum antigens.,"plaque antibody selection: rapid immunological analysis of a large number of recombinant phage clones positive to sera raised against plasmodium falciparum antigens.. A library of Plasmodium falciparum genomic DNA on the lambda gt11 phage vector was screened for clones positive to a rabbit serum raised against a purified fraction of P. falciparum proteins and a pool of sera from malaria patients. The positive clones were characterized with antibodies purified by the plaque antibody selection technique. This technique consist of purifying specific antibodies on a nitrocellulose filter blotted directly on a lawn of plaques of an antigen-producing phage clone. The purified antibodies are then used as a probe in a Western blot of parasite protein extract, for preliminary characterization of the clones. Using this method, two different clones coding for P. falciparum antigens were identified with the rabbit serum and about 20 with the human sera. This method can be of general use, i.e. it is not limited to parasite systems, and facilitates the immunological analysis and identification of a large number of clones.",1986
s84241,the requirement for lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 in homotypic leukocyte adhesion stimulated by phorbol ester.,"the requirement for lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 in homotypic leukocyte adhesion stimulated by phorbol ester.. Lymphocytes become adherent and aggregate after stimulation with phorbol esters such as PMA. Time-lapse video showed that aggregating cells were motile and exhibited vigorous pseudopodial movements. Adhesion sites were initiated between pseudopodia of neighboring cells, and then moved to the uropod. PMA-stimulated aggregation by EBV-transformed B cell lines, SKW-3 (a T cell line), differentiated U937 (a monocytic line), and blood lymphocytes was inhibited by mAbs to LFA-1. A number of different mAb to the LFA-1 alpha and beta subunits and F(ab')2 and Fab' fragments inhibited aggregation. Furthermore, lymphoblasts from normal individuals, but not from LFA-1-deficient patients, aggregated in response to PMA. These findings suggest LFA-1 is critically involved in stimulated lymphocyte adhesion. LFA-1 expression was not increased by PMA stimulation, showing that other mechanisms regulate LFA-1-dependent adherence. LFA-1-deficient patient cells were able to coaggregate with LFA-1+ cells, showing that aggregation is not mediated by like-like interactions between LFA-1 molecules on opposite cells. Aggregation was Mg+2-dependent, inhibited by cytochalasin B, and was reversed when LFA-1 mAb was added to preformed aggregates. Previous findings suggesting that LFA-1 is important in a wide variety of leukocyte functions are elucidated by this work, which shows that LFA-1 is a general leukocyte cell adhesion molecule, the activity of which is regulated by cell activation.",1986
s84329,expression of hepatitis b virus core antigen gene in saccharomyces cerevisiae: synthesis of two polypeptides translated from different initiation codons.,"expression of hepatitis b virus core antigen gene in saccharomyces cerevisiae: synthesis of two polypeptides translated from different initiation codons.. Two recombinant plasmids were constructed that allow expression of the hepatitis B core (HBc) antigen gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae under the control of the repressible acid phosphatase promoter. One plasmid was designed to produce polypeptide I, which consists of 183 amino acids, and the other plasmid was designed to produce polypeptide II, which has an additional 29-amino-acid sequence at the amino terminus of polypeptide I. The viral genome may code for either one or both of these two polypeptides, depending upon the selection of initiation codons. Both polypeptides produced in yeast cells reacted with anti-HBc antibody and were assembled into spherical particles approximately 27 nm in diameter. Particles made of polypeptide I were stable, whereas those made of polypeptide II readily dissociated when exposed to high salt levels. The antigenicity of the HBc (as defined by its reactivity to anti-HBc antibody in the reversed passive hemagglutination assay) disappeared as the particle dissociated, leaving materials that sedimented slowly and that reacted to anti-hepatitis B e antibody. These observations strongly suggest that native viral cores are mostly (if not all) made of polypeptide I, because it is reasonably stable, and that the N-terminal portion of this polypeptide has some, but not a profound, influence on the assembly of polypeptides into particles.",1986
s84399,impaired assembly and transport of hla-a and -b antigens in a mutant txb cell hybrid.,"impaired assembly and transport of hla-a and -b antigens in a mutant txb cell hybrid.. Biosynthesis of HLA class I antigens has been studied in a variant B-LCLxT-LCL hybrid, 174XCEM.T2. This cell line encodes HLA-A2 and -B5, but expresses only small amounts of A2 antigen and undetectable B5 antigen at the cell surface due to a mutation inactivating a trans-acting regulatory gene encoded within the class II region of the human major histocompatibility complex. Northern blot analysis with HLA-A- and HLA-B-specific probes shows that 174XCEM.T2 synthesizes quantities of A and B locus mRNA comparable with its class I antigen-positive parent cell line. Immune precipitation studies indicate that 174XCEM.T2 synthesizes normal HLA heavy chains and beta 2-microglobulin which fail to form dimers. The heavy chains are N-glycosylated normally, but processing of the glycan to the complex form does not occur. In addition, free heavy chains in this cell line are not phosphorylated. Thus, the majority of class I heavy chains in 174XCEM.T2 do not combine with beta 2-microglobulin, and are not processed or transported to the cell surface. As both subunits are synthesized in normal amounts, we propose that an additional molecule absent from 174XCEM.T2 and encoded by an HLA-linked gene is necessary for efficient assembly of class I antigen subunits.",1986
s84407,two toxin-converting phages from escherichia coli o157:h7 strain 933 encode antigenically distinct toxins with similar biologic activities.,"two toxin-converting phages from escherichia coli o157:h7 strain 933 encode antigenically distinct toxins with similar biologic activities.. Escherichia coli O157:H7 strain 933 contains two distinct toxin-converting phages (933J and 933W). The biologic activities and antigenic relationship between the toxins produced by 933J and 933W lysogens of E. coli K-12, as well as the homology of the genes that encode the two toxins, were examined in this study. The 933J and 933W toxins, like Shiga toxin produced by Shigella dysenteriae type 1, were cytotoxic for the same cell lines, caused paralysis and death in mice, and caused fluid accumulation in rabbit ileal segments. The cytotoxic activity of 933J toxin for HeLa cells was neutralized by anti-Shiga toxin, whereas the activity of 933W toxin was not neutralized by this antiserum. In contrast, an antiserum prepared against E. coli K-12(933W) neutralized 933W toxin but not 933J toxin or Shiga toxin. For E. coli 933, most of the cell-associated cytotoxin was neutralized by anti-Shiga toxin, whereas most of the extracellular cytotoxin was neutralized by anti-933W toxin. However, a mixture of these antisera indicated the presence of both toxins in cell lysates and culture supernatants. Among 50 elevated cytotoxin-producing strains of E. coli, we identified 11 strains isolated from cases of diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, or hemolytic uremic syndrome that produced cell-associated cytotoxins which were neutralized by the 933W antitoxin. Southern hybridization studies showed that the cloned toxin structural genes from phage 933J hybridized with DNA from phage 933W under conditions estimated to allow no more than 26% base-pair mismatch. These findings indicate that E. coli produces two genetically related but antigenically distinct cytotoxins with similar biologic activities which we propose to name Shiga-like toxins I and II. Strains of E. coli that produce elevated levels of Shiga-like toxin I or Shiga-like toxin II, or both, have been associated with the clinical syndromes of diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and hemolytic uremic syndrome.",1986
s84744,structural diversity of the major surface antigen of plasmodium falciparum merozoites.,"structural diversity of the major surface antigen of plasmodium falciparum merozoites.. The structures of the major merozoite surface antigen of Plasmodium falciparum and the gene encoding it were indistinguishable for the Wellcome strain and the Thai clone T9/94 but different for clones T9/96, T9/98, and T9/101. The central portion of the gene is subject to the greatest variation in structure. The protein from all five lines was found to be posttranslationally modified by covalent addition of both carbohydrate and fatty acid.",1986
s84762,precore sequence of hepatitis b virus inducing e antigen and membrane association of the viral core protein.,"precore sequence of hepatitis b virus inducing e antigen and membrane association of the viral core protein.. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA contains a precore (pre-c) sequence of 29 codons with unknown function upstream of its gene for the major core protein. Its significance was studied by expression of core proteins with and without pre-c in Escherichia coli. Core protein without pre-c, P22c, assembled spontaneously to core particles and formed core antigen. It had the same size and antigenicity as core particles from infected liver. Core protein with pre-c, P25e, instead formed membrane-associated e antigen (HBeAg). The data suggest that pre-c functions as a signal peptide for the attachment of core protein P25e to cellular membranes. This hypothesis can explain the not yet understood relation between viremia and HbeAg and the protective role of anti-HBe antibody.",1986
s84999,unusually high-level expression of a foreign gene (hepatitis b virus core antigen) in saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"unusually high-level expression of a foreign gene (hepatitis b virus core antigen) in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. As a model system for the study of factors affecting gene expression, hepatitis B virus core antigen (HBcAg) has been expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The singularly high levels of expression achieved are approx. 40% of the soluble yeast protein. The HBcAg polypeptides are present as 28-nm particles which are morphologically indistinguishable from HBcAg particles in human plasma and are highly immunogenic in mice. The plasmid construction employed to achieve these very high levels of expression utilizes the constitutively active yeast promoter from the GAP491 gene which is fused in a way that all non-translated sequences flanking the HBcAg coding region are yeast-derived. Hybrid constructions containing 3'-nontranslated viral DNA (yeast 5') or 5'-nontranslated viral DNA (yeast 3') as well as a construction with both 5'- and 3'-nontranslated viral DNA also have been made. A comparison of these constructions for levels of HBcAg expression indicates that the strongest contributor to the high levels of protein is the presence of 5'-flanking sequences which are yeast-derived; secondarily, a significant improvement can be achieved if the 3'-flanking sequences also are yeast-derived. The high abundance of HBcAg in the highest producer is explicable in part on the basis of the very high stability in yeast cells of HBcAg polypeptides. Analysis of the HBcAg coding sequence reveals a very low index of codon bias for S. cerevisiae, largely discounting codon usage as a contributor to the high level of protein obtained.",1986
s85281,efficacy of murine malaria sporozoite vaccines: implications for human vaccine development.,"efficacy of murine malaria sporozoite vaccines: implications for human vaccine development.. As part of a study of potential vaccines against malaria, the protective efficacy of sporozoite subunit vaccines was determined by using the Plasmodium berghei murine malaria model. Mice were immunized with recombinant DNA-produced or synthetic peptide-carrier subunit vaccines derived from the repetitive epitopes of the Plasmodium berghei circumsporozoite gene, or with radiation-attenuated sporozoites. Immunization with subunit vaccines elicited humoral responses that were equivalent to or greater than those elicited by irradiated sporozoites, yet the protection against sporozoite challenge induced by either of the subunit vaccines was far less than that achieved by immunization with attenuated sporozoites. Passive and adoptive transfer studies demonstrated that subunit vaccines elicited predominantly antibody-mediated protection that was easily overcome whereas irradiated sporozoites induced potent cell-mediated immunity that protected against high challenge doses of sporozoites. These studies indicate that new strategies designed to induce cellular immunity will be required for efficacious sporozoite vaccines.",1987
s85327,cloning and expression in escherichia coli of the ibc protein genes of group b streptococci: binding of human immunoglobulin a to the beta antigen.,"cloning and expression in escherichia coli of the ibc protein genes of group b streptococci: binding of human immunoglobulin a to the beta antigen.. Total-cell DNA isolated from a highly virulent serotype Ic strain of a group B streptococcus was used to construct a gene bank with bacteriophage lambda L47.1 in Escherichia coli K-12. Recombinant phage plaques in the bank were immunoblotted by using anti-alpha- and anti-beta-specific antibodies directed towards the Ibc proteins purified from the streptococcal cell surface, and hybrid phages expressing the alpha protein (lambda alpha +) and the beta protein (lambda beta +) were identified. DNA inserts in these phages were subcloned into E. coli high-copy-number plasmid vectors to produce stable alpha + (pPHC10) and beta + (pPHC8 and pPHC33) recombinant plasmids, and restriction maps of the cloned streptococcal sequences were constructed. Antibodies against the two Streptococcus-derived proteins reacted with high-molecular-weight polypeptides made in E. coli cells carrying the corresponding hybrid plasmids and with several degradation peptides from them. A 190-kilodalton alpha protein, previously undetected, was identified; this species may be the native alpha protein or a precursor of it. In addition, mutagenesis of the cloned sequences was carried out by using the omega fragment to determine the direction of transcription. In E. coli, the beta protein, but not the alpha protein, bound human immunoglobulin A (IgA) in Western blots, and neither protein bound IgG or IgM.",1987
s85737,nucleotide sequence of the woodchuck hepatitis virus surface antigen mrnas and the variability of three overlapping viral genes.,"nucleotide sequence of the woodchuck hepatitis virus surface antigen mrnas and the variability of three overlapping viral genes.. A cDNA library was constructed from the liver of a woodchuck chronically infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV). A clone, pWS23, encompassing the entire surface and X genes of WHV was isolated. Comparison of the complete nucleotide (nt) sequence of pWS23 with those of genomic DNAs from two different WHV isolates showed that it contained a nearly full-length copy of the major mRNA encoding the viral surface antigen (S mRNA). It was colinear with the WHV genome over 1858 nt and terminated 22 nt downstream from the variant polyadenylation signal within the core gene. Evidence for heterogeneity of the 5'-terminal region of the S mRNA came from direct sequencing of the 5' extremities of 20 cDNA inserts, similar to that of pWS23, isolated from a second cDNA library of the same woodchuck liver. In agreement with previous mapping studies of hepadnaviruses, two main initiation regions of S mRNA were localized 27-30 nt upstream and 22-49 nt downstream from the pre-S2 initiation codon. Further analysis of the amino acid sequences of the surface, polymerase and X genes of WHV showed a high conservation among three WHV isolates and a similar distribution of conserved and variable regions in woodchuck and human hepatitis B viruses.",1986
s85767,characterization of a mouse/human chimeric monoclonal antibody (17-1a) to a colon cancer tumor-associated antigen.,"characterization of a mouse/human chimeric monoclonal antibody (17-1a) to a colon cancer tumor-associated antigen.. Mouse monoclonal antibody 17-1A is specific for an antigen expressed on cells of human gastrointestinal malignancies and has been used in radioimmune imaging and therapy trials for patients with colon and pancreatic cancer. The cell line SG3/5 was generated by transfection of a nonproducing mouse myeloma line (SP2/0) with a chimeric gene construct composed of variable regions from the mouse 17-1A immunoglobulin (gamma 2a, kappa) and constant regions of human k and gamma 3 immunoglobulin genes. The secreted immunoglobulin was bound by mouse monoclonal antibodies to human IgG(Fc) and IgG3 but not by staphylococcal protein A. Gel filtration HPLC profiles of purified chimeric antibody were similar to normal human IgG3 but quite different from native 17-1A and normal human IgG1, 2, and 4. Native and chimeric 17-1A had similar patterns of reactivity with colon cancer, other adenocarcinoma, and leukemic cell lines. Competitive inhibition documented that native and chimeric 17-1A had identical capacities to inhibit radiolabeled native 17-1A binding to colon cancer cell lines. Thus, the chimeric 17-1A exhibits molecular characteristics of normal human IgG3 but retains the specificity and binding affinity of the native 17-1A murine monoclonal antibody. The native and chimeric 17-1A mediated similar modest degrees of human lymphocyte and monocyte ADCC in a 4-hr 51Cr release assay, and both failed to mediate complement lysis of colon carcinoma cell lines in the presence of human complement. This human/mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody may be a good candidate for use in clinical trials because it retains the tumor antigen specificity and human effector cell recognition of the native 17-1A, would presumably have a fivefold to 10-fold longer circulating half-life in man, and should be considerably less immunogenic as compared with native murine immunoglobulins.",1987
s86149,generation of an antibody with enhanced affinity and specificity for its antigen by protein engineering.,"generation of an antibody with enhanced affinity and specificity for its antigen by protein engineering.. A detailed description of the interactions between an antibody and its epitope is necessary to allow an understanding of the way in which antibodies bind to antigenic surfaces presented by foreign molecules. Ideally this should be done by analysis of crystal structures of antibody-antigen complexes, but so far only two of these are available. An alternative strategy combines molecular modelling with site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) and using this we have generated a preliminary model of the complex between Gloop2, an antibody raised against a peptide containing the 'loop' determinant of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL) which also binds the native protein, and its epitope on the protein surface. The main predictions from our model were; (1) that the surface of interaction between the antibody and the antigen is large (20 A X 15 A) and involves all the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), (2) that electrostatic interactions were important in the formation of the complex, and (3) that conformational changes in either the loop or in the CDRs may occur during the formation of the complex. Here we report SDM studies which test some of these predictions; removal of two charged residues at the periphery of the combining site increases the affinity of the antibody for its antigen over 8-fold and decreases its ability to cross-react with closely-related antigens. This result is at variance with our original prediction but can be accommodated within our newly refined model; the role of electrostatics in antigen-antibody interactions is now questionable.",1987
s86689,isolation and characterization of full-length functional cdna clones for human carcinoembryonic antigen.,"isolation and characterization of full-length functional cdna clones for human carcinoembryonic antigen.. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) expression is perhaps the most prevalent of phenotypic changes observed in human cancer cells. The molecular genetic basis of this phenomenon, however, is completely unknown. Twenty-seven CEA cDNA clones were isolated from a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line. Most of these clones are full length and consist of a number (usually three) of surprisingly similar long (534 base pairs) repeats between a 5' end of 520 base pairs and a 3' end with three different termination points. The predicted translation product of these clones consists of a processed signal sequence of 34 amino acids, an amino-terminal sequence of 107 amino acids, which includes the known terminal amino acid sequence of CEA, three repeated domains of 178 amino acids each, and a membrane-anchoring domain of 27 amino acids, giving a total of 702 amino acids and a molecular weight of 72,813 for the mature protein. The repeated domains have conserved features, including the first 67 amino acids at their N termini and the presence of four cysteine residues. Comparisons with the amino acid sequences of other proteins reveals homology of the repeats with various members of the immunoglobulin supergene family, particularly the human T-cell receptor gamma chain. CEA cDNA clones in the SP-65 vector were shown to produce transcripts in vitro which could be translated in vitro to yield a protein of molecular weight 73,000 which in turn could be precipitated with CEA-specific antibodies. CEA cDNA clones were also inserted into an animal cell expression vector and introduced by transfection into mammalian cell lines. These transfectants produced a CEA-immunoprecipitable glycoprotein which could be visualized by immunofluorescence on the cell surface.",1987
s86841,multiple topogenic sequences determine the transmembrane orientation of the hepatitis b surface antigen.,"multiple topogenic sequences determine the transmembrane orientation of the hepatitis b surface antigen.. To investigate the mechanism by which complex membrane proteins achieve their correct transmembrane orientation, we examined in detail the hepatitis B surface antigen for sequences which determine its membrane topology. The results demonstrated the presence of at least two kinds of topogenic elements: an N-terminal uncleaved signal sequence and an internal element containing both signal and stop-transfer function. Fusion of reporter groups to either end of the protein suggested that both termini are translocated across the membrane bilayer. We propose that this topology is generated by the conjoint action of both elements and involves a specifically oriented membrane insertion event mediated by the internal sequence. The functional properties of each element can be instructively compared with those of simpler membrane proteins and may provide insight into the generation of other complex protein topologies.",1987
s87050,hepatitis delta virus: protein composition of delta antigen and its hepatitis b virus-derived envelope.,"hepatitis delta virus: protein composition of delta antigen and its hepatitis b virus-derived envelope.. Hepatitis delta virus (HDV)-associated particles were purified from the serum of an experimentally infected chimpanzee by size chromatography and by density centrifugation. Hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg) was detected after mild detergent treatment at a column elution volume corresponding to 36-nm particles and banded at a density of 1.25 g/ml. The serum had an estimated titer of 10(9) to 10(10) HDV-associated particles and had only a 10-fold excess of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) not associated with HDAg. Therefore, HDV appears to be much more efficiently packed and secreted than is its helper virus, hepatitis B virus (HBV), which is usually accompanied by a 1,000-fold excess of HBsAg. The protein compositions of the HDAg-containing particles were analyzed by immunoblotting with HDAg-, HBsAg-, and hepatitis B core antigen-specific antisera and monoclonal antibodies to HBV surface gene products. The HBsAg envelope of HDAg contained approximately 95% P24/GP27s, 5% GP33/36s, and 1% P39/GP42s proteins. This protein composition was more similar to that of the 22-nm particles of HBsAg than to that of complete HBV. The significant amount of GP33/36s suggests that the HBsAg component of the HDV-associated particle carries the albumin receptor. Two proteins of 27 and 29 kilodaltons which specifically bound antibody to HDAg but not HBV-specific antibodies were detected in the interior of the 36-nm particle. Since these proteins were structural components of HDAg and were most likely coded for by HDV, they were designated P27d and P29d.",1986
s87486,immunochemical structure of the hepatitis b surface antigen vaccine--ii. analysis of antibody responses in human sera against the envelope proteins.,"immunochemical structure of the hepatitis b surface antigen vaccine--ii. analysis of antibody responses in human sera against the envelope proteins.. Antibody responses to the three envelope (env) proteins of hepatitis B viral particles (HB-VP): the S-encoded P25 polypeptide; the pre-S(2)- and S-encoded GP33/GP36 polypeptide; and the large entire env gene (pre-S + S) product, P39/GP42, were investigated using a Western immunoblotting assay (WIBA). HB-VP proteins separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose by electroblotting were used as antigenic probes to determine the polypeptide specificity of these antibodies present in immune individuals. Antisera from human subjects either after a natural HBV infection or after active immunization with the hepatitis B vaccine licensed in France were selected on the basis of a positive serological RIA test for antibodies against hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). In all studied cases, the lack of reactivity of the anti-HBs/P25 antibodies in blots from reduced SDS gels confirms that the S-related-determinants have a conformation sensitive to denaturing agents. In contrast, the anti-pre-S(2)/GP33-GP36 antibodies and the anti-pre-S(1)/P39-GP42 antibodies can be easily detected in WIBA, providing these antibodies recognize the disulfide-bond independent pre-S determinants on the denatured env proteins. However, antisera raised in guinea-pigs against individual HBsAg polypeptides contain antibodies reacting with denatured S-proteins, suggesting that the sequential S-determinants are lost during HBV morphogenesis. Antibody responses in HBV convalescing patients or vaccinated healthy donors are shown to be characterized by: an early transient polypeptide specific-antibody response to pre-S(2)-sequences (detected in WIBA); a persistent antibody response to conformation-dependent S-determinants (detected in RIA). This implies that effective long-term protection against HBV infection requires antibodies directed to native env proteins.",1986

These clone banks have been screened by message selection (hybrid release translation) and clones containing fragments of genes encoding schistosome antigens have been identified by immunoprecipitation of the corresponding mRNA in vitro translation product. Over 50 clones encoding schistosome antigens have been identified including those of the 100 000, 86 000, 28 000, and 27 000 molecular weight surface antigen precursors.",1986
s88793,efficient generation of antibodies to oncoproteins by using synthetic peptide antigens.,"efficient generation of antibodies to oncoproteins by using synthetic peptide antigens.. To examine the efficiency of generating protein-reactive antipeptide antibodies, 35 peptides encoded by retroviral or cellular oncogenes were used to immunize rabbits. Thirty-two peptides elicited antipeptide antibodies, of which 56% reacted with their respective oncoproteins. The length of the immunizing peptide was an important factor in generating antibodies reactive with native protein. Similar peptides differing in a single or a few amino acids could elicite antisera of markedly different reactivities.",1985
s88901,expression of hepatitis b surface antigen with a recombinant adenovirus.,"expression of hepatitis b surface antigen with a recombinant adenovirus.. Early region 1 of the adenovirus type 5 genome was replaced with a DNA sequence containing the gene coding for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) flanked by the major late promoter from adenovirus 2 and processing and polyadenylylation signals from simian virus 40. In one type of hybrid virus only the adenovirus 2 major late promoter, including just 33 base pairs of the adenovirus type 2 tripartite leader, preceded the coding region of the HBsAg gene. In another, this region was preceded by both the adenovirus major late promoter and almost the entire tripartite leader. The structure of the substituted sequence in each of the recombinant viral DNAs was identical to that in the plasmids used to construct the viruses. Approximately equivalent amounts of HBsAg-specific mRNA were produced late in infection with each recombinant virus. Although HBsAg production was detected late in infection of the hybrid virus not containing the full tripartite leader sequence, its level was 1/70th of that obtained with the hybrid virus containing this sequence. One likely interpretation is that the presence of the tripartite leader at the 5' end of this mRNA is critical for the synthesis of HBsAg polypeptide in the late stage of infection. HBsAg produced upon infection with the hybrid adenoviruses was glycosylated and secreted into the culture medium as particles that were essentially indistinguishable from the 22-nm particles found in human serum.",1985
s88914,specific expression of hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag) in transgenic mice.,"specific expression of hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag) in transgenic mice.. Two transgenic mice were obtained that contain in their chromosomes the complete hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome except for the core gene. These mice secrete particles of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) in the serum. In one mouse, HBV DNA sequences that had integrated at two different sites were shown to segregate independently in the first filial generation (F1) and only one of the sequences allowed expression of the surface antigen. Among these animals the males produced five to ten times more HBsAg than the females. A 2.1-kilobase messenger RNA species comigrating with the major surface gene messenger RNA is expressed specifically in the liver in the two original mice. The results suggest that the HBV sequences introduced into the mice are able to confer a tissue-specific expression to the S gene. In addition, the HBV transgenic mice represent a new model for the chronic carrier state of hepatitis B virus infection.",1985

The viral nucleoprotein (NP), a major internal virion structural protein, has been implicated as a possible target antigen for cross-reactive CTL. To directly examine CTL recognition of NP, a vaccinia virus recombinant containing a DNA copy of an influenza A virus NP gene was constructed. We found that murine cells infected with this virus were efficiently lysed in a major histocompatibility complex-restricted manner by cross-reactive CTL populations obtained by immunization with a variety of influenza A virus subtypes. In addition, the recombinant vaccinia virus containing the PR8 NP gene was able to both stimulate and prime for a vigorous secondary cross-reactive CTL response. Significantly, splenocytes from mice primed by inoculation with the recombinant vaccinia virus containing the PR8 NP gene could be stimulated by influenza A viruses of all three major human subtypes. Finally, unlabeled target competition experiments suggest that NP is a major, but not the sole, viral target antigen recognized by cross-reactive CTL.",1985
s89013,genes regulating hla class i antigen expression in t-b lymphoblast hybrids.,"genes regulating hla class i antigen expression in t-b lymphoblast hybrids.. Regulation of HLA class I and class II antigen expression was studied in hybrids of human T and B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL). The T-LCL CEMR.3 expresses no HLA class II antigens. It expresses little total HLA class I antigen and no HLA-B antigens. The B-LCL 721.174 is a radiation-induced variant immunoselected for loss of class II antigen expression. In addition to showing a deletion of all HLA-DR and DQ structural genes, 721.174 expresses no HLA-B antigens and a decreased level of HLA-A antigen compared with the parental cell line. A hybrid of 721.174 and CEMR.3 expresses class II antigens encoded by CEMR.3. Increased expression of HLA class I antigens encoded by both 721.174 and CEMR.3 was also observed. Specifically, the previously undetectable HLA-B5 and HLA-Bw6 antigens encoded by 721.174 and CEMR.3, respectively, were present on the hybrid. Increased expression of the HLA-A2 antigen encoded by 721.174 was also observed. An immunoselected variant of the hybrid lacking both CEMR.3-derived copies of chromosome 6 lost expression of the HLA-B5 antigen encoded by 721.174 and expressed a decreased amount of HLA-A2. From these data, we infer that two complementary trans-acting factors mediate enhanced expression of HLA class I antigens in the hybrid. One of these factors is provided by a gene located on chromosome 6 derived from CEMR.3. The second factor, introduced by 721.174, is the gene previously postulated to induce expression of CEMR.3-encoded class I antigens in hybrids of CEMR.3 with B-LCL.",1985
s89028,abrogation of metastatic properties of tumour cells by de novo expression of h-2k antigens following h-2 gene transfection.,abrogation of metastatic properties of tumour cells by de novo expression of h-2k antigens following h-2 gene transfection.. H-2 gene transfection was used to restore expression of H-2K antigens in metastatic and non-metastatic subclones of a murine fibrosarcoma that lack their major histocompatibility complex-encoded H-2K antigens. De novo expression of H-2K reduced tumorigenicity and abolished the formation of metastasis in syngeneic mice. Expression of H-2K may lead to effective recognition of the disseminating tumour cells by the host immune system.,1985
s89040,growth of normal human t lymphocytes induced by monoclonal antibody to the t cell antigen receptor.,growth of normal human t lymphocytes induced by monoclonal antibody to the t cell antigen receptor.. A monoclonal antibody (mAb) called 30-3D6 has been raised against the T cell antigen receptor analogue on a human T cell leukemia cell line HPB-ALL. This mAb comodulates the T3 molecule on HPB-ALL and precipitates the heterodimeric structure previously described as a T cell idiotypic receptor analogue on this cell line. 30-3D6 reacts with a variable percentage of normal T cells (up to 6%) depending on the donor and this number is stable on repeated sampling and is not affected by the temperature of the reaction. When normal T cells from a high frequency donor are stimulated with 30-3D6 and interleukin 2 in vitro the idiotype-positive (Id+) population can be expanded. Large numbers of greater than 90% Id+ T cells can be generated. Id cells are present in both the helper and cytotoxic suppressor subsets.,1985
s89079,monoclonal antiidiotypic antibodies related to a murine oncofetal bladder tumor antigen induce specific cell-mediated tumor immunity.,"monoclonal antiidiotypic antibodies related to a murine oncofetal bladder tumor antigen induce specific cell-mediated tumor immunity.. Rat monoclonal antibody 6.10 recognizes a 175-kDa protein expressed in all BALB/c mouse transitional cell bladder carcinomas tested, in epithelial cells of the mouse embryo, and in a few epithelial cells of adult mice. The antibody was used as an immunogen to generate two mouse monoclonal antibodies, 21D9 and 43A10, which bind to idiotopes on antibody 6.10 associated with the binding site for the 175-kDa antigen. The antiidiotypic antibodies induced bladder tumor-specific, cell-mediated immunity when injected into syngeneic mice, as shown by delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions in vivo and leukocyte adherence inhibition reactions in vitro. Tumor specificity was demonstrated by employing as controls a chemically induced BALB/c fibrosarcoma, MCA-1511 (MCA, 3-methylcholanthrene), and its corresponding antiidiotypic antibody, 5.96. Lymphocytes from mice sensitized with antibody 21D9 or 5.96 specifically recognized antigens in extracts of BALB/c bladder carcinoma BTCC-1660 (BTCC, bladder transitional cell carcinoma) and sarcoma MCA-1511, respectively, as shown by leukocyte adherence inhibition reactivity. This reactivity was selectively abrogated by prior treatment of the sensitized cells with the appropriate antiidiotypic antibodies and complement. An antigen recognized in vitro by antibody 21D9-sensitized lymphocytes could be separated from BTCC-1660 extract by immunoabsorption with antibody 6.10 and elution with acidic buffer. Our findings indicate that the oncofetal antigen defined by antibody 6.10 is recognized by the immune system of syngeneic mice and suggest that antiidiotypic antibodies related to certain oncofetal antigens can be used to immunize against syngeneic tumors.",1985
s89539,genes for the major protein antigens of the leprosy parasite mycobacterium leprae.,"genes for the major protein antigens of the leprosy parasite mycobacterium leprae.. Leprosy, a chronic infectious disease afflicting between 10 and 15 million people, is caused by the obligate intracellular parasite Mycobacterium leprae. Although M. leprae was the first identified bacterial pathogen of man, basic biochemical, immunological, diagnostic and therapeutic investigations have been severely limited because it remains one of the few human pathogens that have not been cultured in vitro. An M. leprae recombinant DNA expression library was constructed to provide a source of genes encoding proteins relevant for such studies. Monoclonal antibodies directed against M. leprae specific antigens have been used to isolate the genes encoding the five most immunogenic protein antigens of the leprosy bacillus. We report here that M. leprae specific epitopes recognized by all of 13 monoclonal antibodies tested were produced by recombinant phage in Escherichia coli.",1985

We have constructed an expression plasmid for regulated expression of the hepatitis B surface antigen gene in yeast using promoter of the yeast Pho5 gene. In the yeast transformants, the monomeric HBsAg (22K dalton) was estimated to constitute approximately 3% of the total proteins. On extraction, the HBsAg was found to have a buoyant density of 1.18 g/ml and an Sw.20 value of 54. Electron microscopy revealed particles of heterogeneous size ranging from 18-28 nm. When the yeast HBsAg was used to immunize guinea pigs, the anti-HBsAg antibodies produced could react with human serum HBsAg.",1985

An enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli plasmid encoding colonization factor antigen (CFA) I fimbriae and heat-stable toxin was transferred into a streptomycin-resistant mutant of the Salmonella typhi galE strain Ty21a (a live attenuated oral typhoid vaccine). The virulence plasmid-carrying transconjugants produced CFA I fimbriae and heat-stable toxin. The marked production of CFA I fimbriae was observed even in a vaccine medium for Ty21a. The data lead to a new type of potential live oral vaccine, S. typhi Ty21a producing enteroadhesion fimbriae.",1985
s89908,development and characterization of cold-adapted viruses for use as live virus vaccines.,"development and characterization of cold-adapted viruses for use as live virus vaccines.. Representative viruses from twelve RNA and two DNA virus genera have been successfully adapted to growth at sub-optimal temperature (cold-adapted). In almost every case, there was a correlation between acquisition of the cold-adaptation phenotype and loss of virulence in the normal host whether animal or man. Overall, the best method of cold adaptation to develop a live virus vaccine line appeared to be a stepwise lowering of the growth temperature allowing time for multiple lesions to occur and/or be selected. In addition, the starting virus should be a recent isolate not as yet adapted to a tissue culture host and the cold-adaptation process should then occur in a host heterologous to the virus' normal host. These viruses have been reviewed in the light of their cold-adaptation method and successful production of an attenuated line as virus vaccine candidate. Finally, detailed information is presented for the cold-adaptation process in influenza virus.",1985
s90199,antigen-binding specificities of antibodies are primarily determined by seven residues of vh.,"antigen-binding specificities of antibodies are primarily determined by seven residues of vh.. Although the antigen-binding pocket of all antibodies consists of VL + VH dimers (where VL and VH represent immunoglobulin light and heavy chain regions, respectively), subgroups of their VH largely determine their antigen-binding specificities. This VH subgroup dependence automatically relegates subsidiary roles to VL as a whole and to the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR-3) of VH encoded by independent diversity (D) and joining (J) coding segments in determining antigen-binding specificities of individual antibodies. As a sequel to our previous paper, which emphasized the role conserved residues in CDR-1 and CDR-2 of VH play in general shaping of the primordial antigen-binding cavity, here we propose that the three short clusters of amino acid sequences in CDR-1 and CDR-2 that are placed in the immediate vicinity of the tryptophan loop primarily determine subgroup-dependent antigen preference of individual VH, therefore, antibodies. The three clusters are the 31st to 35th positions of CDR-1 and the 50th to 52nd and 58th to 60th positions of CDR-2. Of those, the 32nd, 34th, 51st, and 59th positions tend to be occupied by tyrosine, methionine, isoleucine, and tyrosine, respectively. Nevertheless, free amino acid substitutions at the remaining seven sites can generate 20(7) or 1.28 X 10(9) varieties of amino acid sequence combinations. Some of these astronomically numerous sequence combinations no doubt contribute to the maintenance of the vast repertoire of antigen-combining diversity, which might be as large as 10(7), whereas others serve to vary binding affinities toward the same antigen. Ironically, but not surprisingly, a single nonconservative amino acid substitution at one of these sites often suffices to change the antigen preference of VH from one to another, whereas more substitutions affecting two or more clusters are apparently required to change the binding affinity toward the same antigen. In the case of mouse anti-p-azophenylarsonate antibodies, the principle of VH subgroup dependence is violated, their VH belonging to either subgroup 1 or 3. It appears that the mouse genome lacks anti-p-azophenylarsonate germ line VH, residues of CDR-3 derived from one particular JH coding segment coming to rescue to cope with this unnatural man-made antigen.",1985
s90266,an adenovirus type 2 glycoprotein blocks cell surface expression of human histocompatibility class i antigens.,"an adenovirus type 2 glycoprotein blocks cell surface expression of human histocompatibility class i antigens.. The adenovirus type 2 encoded protein E3/19K binds to human histocompatibility class I antigens (HLA). This association occurs both in adenovirus-infected cells and in cells that have been transfected with the gene encoding the E3/19K protein. The formation of the HLA-E3/19K complex prevents the HLA antigens from being correctly processed by inhibiting their terminal glycosylation. This effect is specific for HLA antigens and does not generally involve the glycosyltransferases. Furthermore, the HLA-E3/19K association dramatically reduces the cell surface expression of the HLA antigens. This reduced level of antigens might influence the cytotoxic T cell response. Therefore, our results show a possible molecular mechanism whereby adenoviruses, and perhaps other viruses, delay or escape the cellular immune system of the host.",1985
s90597,immunoglobulin transcripts and molecular history of a hybridoma that produces antibody to carcinoembryonic antigen.,"immunoglobulin transcripts and molecular history of a hybridoma that produces antibody to carcinoembryonic antigen.. Hybridoma CEA 66-E3 secretes only an antibody directed against human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). This hybridoma has been used as a source of mRNA for molecular cloning studies, and for the bacterial expression of anti-CEA heavy and light chains [Cabilly, S. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81 (1984) 3273-3277]. We report here nucleotide sequence data which indicate that hybridoma CEA 66-E3 produces significant levels of several immunoglobulin transcripts in addition to those of anti-CEA. One kappa-chain transcript can be traced back to MOPC21; other transcripts probably come from genes derived from the antigen-stimulated normal lymphocyte. This information should be especially relevant for many hybridomas in which the immortalizing fusion partner is a derivative of MOPC21, for example, X63-Ag8,SP/0-Ag14, or NS1n.",1985

s90953,antigenic variants of cvs rabies virus with altered glycosylation sites.,"antigenic variants of cvs rabies virus with altered glycosylation sites.. The virion-associated glycoprotein of the CVS-11 strain of rabies virus exists in two forms, GI and GII, which differ in their carbohydrate content. The structural relationship between GI and GII is investigated in order to account for the difference in glycosylation. Partial sequence analysis and mapping of tryptic glycopeptides isolated from the parent CVS-11 GI and GII glycoprotein forms revealed that two of the three predicted glycosylation sites (at Asn-204 and Asn-319) were utilized in the GI form whereas only one of these two sites (at Asn-319) was utilized in the GII form. One predicted glycosylation site (at Asn-37) was not utilized in either species. In the variant virus, RV231-22, a single glycoprotein species was detected which corresponded in electrophoretic mobility to the GI form of the parent virus. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the variant glycoprotein gene revealed a base mutation which specifies an amino acid change six residues upstream from the predicted glycosylation site at Asn-204. This single amino acid substitution apparently results in utilization of the signal at Asn-204 in the GII form of RV231-22 virus. The amino acid substitution is discussed in relation to altered conformation. In the variant virus RV194-2 (F3), both GI and GII glycoprotein forms were present, but each revealed slower electrophoretic mobilities compared with the corresponding parent glycoprotein forms in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). An extra glycosylation site was identified in both glycoprotein forms of this variant virus.",1985
s91032,identification of a 68-kilodalton protective protein antigen from bordetella bronchiseptica.,"identification of a 68-kilodalton protective protein antigen from bordetella bronchiseptica.. A 68-kilodalton (kd) outer membrane protein antigen of Bordetella bronchiseptica has been identified by using monoclonal antibodies that recognized two nonoverlapping determinants. Antibody BB05 also reacted with homologous proteins from Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis but not with another 12 organisms from various bacterial genera. Passive injection of BB05 antibody protected mice from aerosol infection with B. bronchiseptica as shown by reduced mortality and reduced pathology of turbinate bones. The 68-kd B. bronchiseptica antigen was purified by BB05-based affinity chromatography and evaluated for its potency to immunize mice actively against either intraperitoneal or aerosol challenge with B. bronchiseptica. Immunization with the 68-kd antigen in incomplete Freund adjuvant significantly reduced the levels of mortality in intraperitoneally challenged mice. In the aerosol infection model, injection of the 68-kd antigen with complete or incomplete Freund adjuvant or saponin reduced the bacterial counts in the lungs of infected mice. These results suggest that the 68-kd protein may represent a potential """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""protective"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" antigen of B. bronchiseptica.",1985
s91125,measurements of the true affinity constant in solution of antigen-antibody complexes by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.,"measurements of the true affinity constant in solution of antigen-antibody complexes by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.. A simple, general procedure is described for the determination of the dissociation constant (KD) of antigen-antibody equilibria in solution. First the monoclonal antibody is incubated in solution with the antigen until the equilibrium is reached; then the proportion of antibody which remains unsaturated at equilibrium is measured by a classical indirect ELISA. The experimental values of KD found by this ELISA procedure for 2 monoclonal antibodies are shown to be very close to those obtained by conventional methods (immunoprecipitation of the radiolabeled antigen, or fluorescence transfer). Moreover, it is shown that, provided the measurements are made under conditions where the total antigen concentration is in large excess over the total antibody concentration, the dissociation constant of antibody-antigen complexes can be determined even with crude preparations of monoclonal antibody. The sensitivity of the ELISA used permits the detection of very small concentrations of antibody and the determination of KD values as small as 10(-9) M. This method also offers the great advantage of dealing with unmodified molecules since no labeling of either the antigen or the antibody is required.",1985

We have isolated a clone containing a gene fragment coding for a 64-kilodalton glycoprotein that is the major late antigen of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Based upon the amino acid sequence of a tryptic peptide of this glycoprotein (HCMVgp64), two sets of mixed-sequence probes, one consisting of a mixture of 16 heptadecadeoxyribonucleotides and the other a mixture of 32 icosadeoxyribonucleotides, were synthesized. A subgenomic library of HCMV (Towne strain) DNA was constructed in plasmid pBR327 and transformants were screened with 32P-labeled aliquots of these synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes. Two clones among 15,000 gave strong positive signals. Plasmid DNA was isolated from the positive clones and characterized by restriction mapping and Southern blot analysis using both probes. The plasmid DNA contained a 2.3-kilobase insert, which yielded an 800-base-pair and a 1500-base-pair fragment after Sau3A digestion. Only the 800-base-pair fragment hybridized to the mixed probes, and DNA sequence analysis revealed that it contains nucleotide sequences compatible with amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides of HCMVgp64. Restriction mapping studies of HCMV DNA using this 32P-labeled 800-base-pair cloned DNA have allowed us to locate this gene fragment in the long unique region of HCMV (Towne strain) genome at approximately equal to 0.5-0.51 map unit.",1984
s100199,transformation mediated by the sv40 t antigens: separation of the overlapping sv40 early genes with a retroviral vector.,"transformation mediated by the sv40 t antigens: separation of the overlapping sv40 early genes with a retroviral vector.. A murine retroviral vector has been used to separate physically the overlapping genes encoded by SV40. This minimal retroviral vector contains LTRs and other cis-acting signals required for infectious RNA virus propagation. We placed the SV40 early region within this DNA and after transfection of cells producing helper Moloney murine leukemia virus, SV40 retroviruses (MV40) could be rescued. Cytoplasmic spliced large T and small t transcripts, as well as unspliced transcripts, are packaged into virions with equal efficiency. Pure SV40 large T retroviruses can be cloned from these heterogeneous virus stocks by secondary transformation of rodent cells. The large T retrovirus stocks morphologically transform primary or established mouse and rat lines with high efficiency. There is little difference in transformation either by agar assay or focus formation between retroviruses carrying both SV40 genes or large T alone. We present quantitative data that demonstrate that abortive transformation of rodent cells by SV40, transient expression of the transformed phenotype after infection, is not manifested by MV40. Thus abortive transformation is not the result of a weakly dominant transforming gene, but rather of the normally inefficient mode of integration and early gene expression of SV40 upon infection of rodent cells.",1984

The nucleotide sequence of human (Wa) rotavirus genome segment 9, which encodes the serotype-specific antigen VP7, has been determined. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of Wa VP7 protein to the sequences of simian SA11 and UK bovine VP7 proteins shows that the majority of the amino acid differences are clustered between amino acid residues 37 through 49, 65 through 75, 87 through 105, 122 through 126, 146 through 149, 178 through 181, and 208 through 242.

We have developed a highly efficient system for producing hepatitis B virus surface antigen in cultured mammalian cells. This system utilizes a recombinant bovine papilloma virus in which the hepatitis surface antigen coding sequences are inserted into the 5' untranslated region of the mouse metallothionein-I gene. Mouse fibroblasts stably transformed with this molecule produce surface antigen at levels as high as 10 mg/L/24 h and can be maintained in continuous culture for up to 85 days.,1984
s100365,major surface antigen gene of a human malaria parasite cloned and expressed in bacteria.,"major surface antigen gene of a human malaria parasite cloned and expressed in bacteria.. The late blood stages of the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, carry a major surface antigen, p190, of molecular weight (Mr) 190,000. This antigenically variable protein is actively processed, first as the parasite matures and again when it is released into the blood stream and invades a new erythrocyte to initiate a cycle of growth. It elicits a strong immune response in man; all tested adult sera from endemic areas have antibodies against this protein. Our evidence indicates that purified p190 can alter the course of parasitaemia in monkeys with falciparum malaria. We have also succeeded in cloning part of the gene for p190 and expressing it in Escherichia coli. To this end we have developed a new technique, antibody select, which greatly simplifies final identification of expressing clones.",1984
s100546,reversion to neurovirulence of the live-attenuated sabin type 3 oral poliovirus vaccine.,"reversion to neurovirulence of the live-attenuated sabin type 3 oral poliovirus vaccine.. The complete nucleotide sequence has been determined of a strain of poliovirus type 3, P3/119, isolated from the central nervous system of a victim of fatal vaccine-associated poliomyelitis. Comparison of this sequence with those obtained previously for the Sabin type 3 vaccine, P3/Leon 12a1b and its neurovirulent progenitor, P3/Leon/37, reveals that these three strains are on a direct geneaological lineage and therefore that P3/119 is a bona fide revertant of the vaccine. P3/119 differs in sequence from its attenuated vaccine parent at just seven positions. Only one of these differences, a mutation from U to C at position 472 in the presumed noncoding region of the genome, is a back mutation to the wild type sequence. Of the six other differences, three give rise to coding changes in virus structural proteins, two are silent changes in the major open reading frame of the genome and one affects the 3'-terminus just prior to the poly A tract. These differences indicate that there are three possible types of molecular change which could, singly or collectively, result in attenuation and reversion to neurovirulence of the Sabin type 3 vaccine.",1984

s100789,the cd4 (t4) antigen is an essential component of the receptor for the aids retrovirus.,"the cd4 (t4) antigen is an essential component of the receptor for the aids retrovirus.. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is characterized by opportunistic infections and by 'opportunistic neoplasms' (for example, Kaposi's sarcoma). Persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) is epidemiologically associated with AIDS, especially in male homosexuals. A subset of T lymphocytes positive for the CD4 antigen (also termed T4 antigen), is depleted in AIDS and PGL patients. A retrovirus found in T-cell cultures from these patients is strongly implicated in the aetiology of AIDS because of the high frequency of isolation and the prevalence of specific antibodies in the patients. Here we have detected cell-surface receptors for the AIDS retrovirus (human T-cell leukaemia virus-III (HTLV-III) and lymphadenopathy-associated virus-1 (LAV-1) isolates) by testing the susceptibility of cells to infection with pseudotypes of vesicular stomatitis virus bearing retroviral envelope antigens, and by the formation of multinucleated syncytia on mixing virus-producing cells with receptor-bearing cells. Receptors were present only on cells expressing CD4 antigen; among 155 monoclonal antibodies tested, each of the 14 anti-CD4 antibodies inhibited formation of syncytia and blocked pseudotypes. Productive infection of CD4+ cells with HTLV-III or LAV-1 markedly reduced cell-surface expression of CD4. In contrast, receptors for HTLV-I and HTLV-II were not restricted to CD4+ cells, were not blocked by anti-CD4 antibodies; cells productively infected with HTLV-I and HTLV-II expressed surface CD4. Hence, we conclude that the CD4 antigen is an essential and specific component of the receptor for the causative agent of AIDS.",1984
s100804,synthesis in animal cells of hepatitis b surface antigen particles carrying a receptor for polymerized human serum albumin.,"synthesis in animal cells of hepatitis b surface antigen particles carrying a receptor for polymerized human serum albumin.. A recombinant plasmid (pSVS dhfr) encoding the pre-S region and the S gene of human hepatitis B virus (HBV) and murine dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) cDNA has been used for the transfection of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) DHFR- cells. Selection of clones resistant to methotrexate has permitted amplification of HBV sequences and an increase in production of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). HBV-specific transcripts have been characterized. The HBsAg 22-nm particles contain a receptor for polymerized human serum albumin (pHSA) and elicit in animals the synthesis of antireceptor antibodies. This property is ascribed to a 34,000-dalton polypeptide in the particles, which is most likely encoded by the S gene and part of the pre-S region. Especially because the pHSA receptor is most abundantly present on the virion and because, in hepatitis B infection, the appearance of anti-pHSA receptor antibodies seems to be a highly reliable criterion for viral clearance, the HBsAg particles obtained may constitute a particularly efficient vaccine.",1984

We have constructed plasmids in which transcription of the surface antigen gene of the human hepatitis B virus (HBsAg) is under the control of the SV40 early promoter. These plasmids have been used to analyze the expression of the HBsAg gene, both in mouse cells and in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells. We have established a Vero cell line continuously expressing HBsAg that is indistinguishable from authentic 22 nm HBsAg particles. Post-transcriptional modification of HBsAg mRNA also appears to occur normally in the monkey cells. These cells might be useful as a source of antigen for the preparation of an antihepatitis vaccine.",1984
s100914,genetically engineered poxviruses: a novel approach to the construction of live vaccines.,"genetically engineered poxviruses: a novel approach to the construction of live vaccines.. Gene splicing techniques have been used to modify the smallpox vaccine virus thus providing a generic approach for the construction of live vaccines directed against a variety of heterologous infectious disease agents. The technique involves translocating a particular gene from an infectious agent into the genetic material of the smallpox vaccine virus. This unique foreign gene, selected because it contains the information essential for the synthesis of an antigen important in immunity to that particular infectious disease agent, is now expressed under the regulation of the engineered smallpox vaccine virus. On immunization with this live recombinant vaccine, the body is fooled into thinking that it was infected by the foreign infectious disease agent and mounts a defensive attack resulting in immunity to that particular infectious agent. Three examples of this approach are provided. Thus, smallpox vaccine viruses were engineered to express genes encoding the hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), the herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D (HSV-gD) and the haemagglutinin (HA) from influenza virus. These foreign gene products when synthesized in vitro under vaccinia virus regulation were shown to be antigenic by a variety of serological tests. When these recombinant vaccinia viruses were inoculated into laboratory animals, the heterologous gene products elicited the production of specific antibodies thus demonstrating that they were immunogenic. Serum neutralizing antibodies were demonstrated to be present for both influenza and herpes simplex viruses. Additional studies in mice showed that a recombinant smallpox vaccine virus expressing a gene from herpes simplex virus effectively protected the mice when subsequently challenged with what would normally be lethal doses of infectious herpes simplex virus.",1984
s101255,recombinant dna technology for the preparation of subunit vaccines.,"recombinant dna technology for the preparation of subunit vaccines.. Recombinant DNA technology appears to be on the verge of producing safe and effective protein vaccines for animal and human diseases. The procedure is applicable to most viruses because their isolated surface proteins generally possess immunogenic activity. Strategies used for the preparation and cloning of the appropriate genes depend on the characteristics of the viral genomes: whether DNA or RNA; their size, strandedness, and segmentation; and whether messenger RNA are monocistronic or polycistronic. Cloned surface proteins of foot-and-mouth disease and hepatitis B viruses are being tested for possible use as practical vaccines. Two doses of the cloned foot-and-mouth disease viral protein have elicited large amounts of neutralizing antibody and have protected cattle and swine against challenge exposure with the virus. Surface proteins have also been cloned for the viruses of fowl plague, influenza, vesicular stomatitis, rabies, and herpes simplex. Cloning is in progress for surface proteins of viruses causing canine parvovirus gastroenteritis, human papillomas, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, Rift Valley fever, and paramyxovirus diseases. In addition, advances in recombinant DNA and other facilitating technologies have rekindled interest in the chemical synthesis of polypeptide vaccines for viral diseases. The bioengineering of bacterial vaccines is also under way. Proteinaceous pili of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli are being produced in E coli K-12 strains for use as vaccines against neonatal diarrheal diseases of livestock.",1982
s101357,isolation of a cdna clone for the human hla-dr antigen alpha chain by using a synthetic oligonucleotide as a hybridization probe.,"isolation of a cdna clone for the human hla-dr antigen alpha chain by using a synthetic oligonucleotide as a hybridization probe.. We have used a synthetic 20-nucleotide hybridization probe to isolate a cDNA clone encoding the alpha chain of the HLA-DR antigen from a cDNA library constructed from membrane-bound poly(A)+ mRNA. A set of synthetic 11-nucleotide fragments, potentially complementary to the codons for amino acids 11-14 of the HLA-DR alpha chain, were used to prime a cDNA synthesis reaction on various poly(A)+ mRNA templates. Extension of the primers in the presence of a single dideoxynucleotide triphosphate resulted in an 18-nucleotide cDNA product whose sequence corresponded to the NH2-terminal amino acids of the HLA-DR alpha chain. An oligonucleotide was synthesized based on this sequence information and its specificity for HLA-DR alpha mRNA was confirmed by primer extension and blot analysis. The cDNA library made from mRNA from the lymphoblastoid cell line CA-SC was probed with 32P-labeled cDNA synthesized on poly(A)+ mRNA from a B-cell line (CA-SC) or from a T-cell line (Molt-4) to enrich for B-cell-specific clones. A set of cDNA clones that hybridized preferentially with the B-cell probe was screened with the 32P-labeled 20-nucleotide probe. The cDNA clone isolated by this procedure is 1,100 nucleotides long; the nucleotide sequence of the 5' end of the cDNA insert corresponds to the amino acid sequence of the HLA-DR alpha chain. Hybridization of this cDNA clone to genomic blots suggests that the HLA-DR alpha chain is encoded by a single-copy gene. One of the restriction endonucleases used in genomic DNA digests reveals a restriction fragment polymorphism.",1982
s101421,expression of plasmids coding for colonization factor antigen ii (cfa/ii) and enterotoxin production in escherichia coli.,"expression of plasmids coding for colonization factor antigen ii (cfa/ii) and enterotoxin production in escherichia coli.. Two plasmids transferred from enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) of serotype O6. H16 and biotypes A and C coded for mannose-resistant haemagglutination (MRHA) and production of heat-stable enterotoxin (ST) and heat-labile enterotoxin (LT). Both plasmids were nonautotransferring being mobilized most efficiently by the R plasmid R100-1. They were similar in their genetic properties being incompatible with each other and plasmids of the Inc group FI. The wild-type strains produced the colonization factor antigen II (CFA/II) which was made up of different coli surface antigens (CS). The biotype A strains produced CS1 and CS3 while the biotype C strains produced CS2 and CS3. These three antigens have the ability to cause MRHA. When plasmids coding for MRHA were transferred to K12 strains, the degree of haemagglutination was markedly reduced and only CS3 was produced. When both plasmids were transferred back into biotype A strains, good MRHA was restored and the strains produced CS1 and CS3. In a biotype C strain CS2 and CS3 were formed. The production of the antigens was compared by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The strains were also examined by electron microscopy where it was found that CS1 and CS2 were fimbrial antigens while CS3 was not.",1983
s101565,influenza antigenic determinants are expressed from haemagglutinin genes cloned in escherichia coli.,influenza antigenic determinants are expressed from haemagglutinin genes cloned in escherichia coli.. A gene sequence for the fowl plague virus (FPV) haemagglutinin molecule has been inserted into a bacterial plasmid such that its transcription is under the control of a promoter derived from the tryptophan operon. Such plasmids direct the synthesis of a protein that reacts specifically with antisera to FPV haemagglutinin. Evidence is also presented that in some cases DNA inserted at the HindIII site of pBR322 is expressed.,1980
s101676,"t cell subsets defined by expression of lyt-1,2,3 and thy-1 antigens. two-parameter immunofluorescence and cytotoxicity analysis with monoclonal antibodies modifies current views.","t cell subsets defined by expression of lyt-1,2,3 and thy-1 antigens. two-parameter immunofluorescence and cytotoxicity analysis with monoclonal antibodies modifies current views.. Using monoclonal antibodies and multiparameter fluorescence analyses, we show that the expression of Lyt-1, Lyt-2, and Lyt-3 on T cell subpopulations is more complex than was originally recognized by the cytotoxic depletion studies with conventional reagents that defined the Lyt-1+2+3+, Lyt-1+2-3-, and Lyt-1-2+3+ populations. We detect at least some Lyt-1 on all T (Thy-1-bearing) lymphocytes; however, in agreement with previous studies, we find that Lyt-2+3+ cells are more difficult to depelete with anti-Lyt-1 than Lyt-1+2-3- cells. Surprisingly, we found a small subpopulation of cells carrying relatively large amounts of Lyt-1 and no Thy-1 detectable by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. We also detect cells with this phenotype histologically in B cell zones (primary follicles) and germinal centers in spleen and lymph nodes. In general, the Lyt-1 only population represents approximately 2% of spleen cells. The relative quantitative expression of Thy-1, Lyt-1, Lyt-2, and Lyt-3 changes systematically during T cell maturation. Among Lyt-1+2+3+ cells in the thymus, Thy-1 and Lyt-2 are high, whereas Lyt-1 is low. Among splenic T cells, in contrast, Thy-1 is low, Lyt-1 is high, and Lyt-2 and Lyt-3 are a little higher than in thymus. In general, Thy-1 expression is negatively correlated with Lyt-1. Thus, even among splenic and lymph node T cells subpopulations exist that tend to be either high Thy-1 and low Lyt-1 or vice versa. Lyt-2+3+ cells represent approximately 85% of thymocytes but only approximately 35% of splenic or lymph node T cells. The Lyt-2+3+ cells are found predominantly in the low Lyt-1, high Thy-1 subpopulation.",1980
s101713,antigenic variation of influenza a virus nucleoprotein detected with monoclonal antibodies.,"antigenic variation of influenza a virus nucleoprotein detected with monoclonal antibodies.. Monoclonal antibodies were used to study antigenic variation in the nucleoprotein of influenza A viruses. We found that the nucleoprotein molecule of the WSN/33 strain possesses at least five different determinants. Viruses of other influenza A virus subtypes showed antigenic variation in these nucleoprotein determinants, although changes in only one determinant were detected in H0N1 and animal strains. The nucleoprotein of human strains isolated from 1933 through 1979 could be divided into six groups, based on their reactivities with monoclonal antibodies; these groups did not correlate with any particular hemagglutinin or neuraminidase subtype. Our results indicate that antigenic variation in the nucleoproteins of influenza A viruses proceeds independently of changes in the viral surface antigens and suggest that point mutations and genetic reassortment may account for nucleoprotein variability.",1980
s101716,biosynthesis of hepatitis b virus surface antigen in escherichia coli.,"biosynthesis of hepatitis b virus surface antigen in escherichia coli.. Hepatitis B is a widespread viral disease. In the absence of cell cultures capable of propagating the virus (HBV) an efficient vaccine has been prepared from viral envelopes isolated from the plasma of chronic carriers. The major polypeptide of the envelope is one of molecular weight 25,000 which carries the surface antigen (HBsAg). Therefore, the biosynthesis of this polypeptide in Escherichia coli may offer an alternative procedure to produce HbsAg free from human proteins. Recently, the HBV genome has been cloned in E.coli. Determination of its primary structure allowed the localization of the gene (called gene S) coding for HBsAg and the synthesis of the core antigen in E.coli has been reported. We have constructed a derivative of bacteriophage lambda carrying a fusion between the beta-galactosidase gene (lacZ) and the HBsAg coding sequence (lambdalacHBs-1). Infection of E.coli with lambdalacHBs-1 leads to the biosynthesis of a polypeptide of molecular weitht 138,000 carrying antigenic determinants of HBV surface antigen.",1980
s101751,igg or igm monoclonal antibodies reactive with different determinants on the molecular complex bearing lyt 2 antigen block t cell-mediated cytolysis in the absence of complement.,"igg or igm monoclonal antibodies reactive with different determinants on the molecular complex bearing lyt 2 antigen block t cell-mediated cytolysis in the absence of complement.. Five rat monoclonal antibodies have been derived that express specificities for determinants present on the molecular complex bearing the Lyt 2 antigen. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 125I-labeled polypeptides precipitated by each of these antibodies reveal 3 components (150,000, 75,000, and 33,000 daltons), and 2 components (44,000 and 33,000 daltons) when analyzed under nonreducing and reducing conditions, respectively. Two of these antibodies are IgG and are specific for the Lyt 2.2 determinant; the other 3 are IgM and react with determinants other than Lyt 2.2, which are nonpolymorphic. Each of the 5 antibodies can block the cytolytic activities of 5-day MLC cells or of cloned cytolytic T cells in the absence of C. Treatment of responding spleen cells with any of these antibodies and C inhibits the generation of cytolytic activity in MLC.",1980
s101836,genetic regulation of variable vi antigen expression in a strain of citrobacter freundii.,"genetic regulation of variable vi antigen expression in a strain of citrobacter freundii.. Certain strains of the genus Citrobacter exhibit a variable expression of the Vi surface antigen that appears to involve a special mechanism for regulation of gene expression. Two nonlinked chromosomal loci, viaA and viaB, are known to determine nonvariable Vi antigen expression in strains of Salmonella. To confirm the presence of analogous loci in Citrobacter and to ascertain whether either of them is involved in variable Vi antigen expression in this organism, donor strains were constructed from Citrobacter freundii WR7004 and used to transfer their Vi antigen-determining genes to ViaA- and ViaB- Salmonella typhi recipient strains. Vi antigen expression in C. freundii was found to be controlled by loci analogous to the Salmonella via genes. S. typhi recipients of the C. freundii viaA+ genes were restored to the full, continuous expression of the Vi antigen normally seen in S. typhi. Thus, the C. freundii viaA genes appeared to play no role in the variable expression of the Vi antigen. In contrast, S. typhi recipients of the C. freundii viaB+ genes exhibited the rapid, reversible alternation between full Vi antigen expression and markedly reduced Vi antigen expression that was seen to occur in the C. freundii parent. The C. freundii viaB locus was thus identified as the one whose genes are regulated so as to produce variable Vi antigen expression. Genes determining another C. freundii surface antigen, the synthesis of which is not affected by the mechanism regulating Vi expression, were coinherited with the C. freundii viaB+ genes. An invertible, insertion sequence element located within the C. freundii viaB locus is proposed to account for the regulation of variable Vi antigen expression.",1981
s101906,antigenic structure of influenza virus haemagglutinin defined by hybridoma antibodies.,"antigenic structure of influenza virus haemagglutinin defined by hybridoma antibodies.. The recurrence of influenza virus infection in man is attributed primarily to changes occurring in the antigenic structure of the viral surface glycoproteins, especially of the haemagglutinin (HA) molecule. Comparative antigenic analysis of epidemic influenza virus strains has allowed the description of 'strain-specific' and 'cross-reactive' antigenic determinants. However, the interpretation of these findings remained ambiguous, because the specificity of the applied antisera was insufficiently defined and because the antigenic differences among the HA molecules of various epidemic virus strains resulted presumably from a large number of amino acid substitutions. Thus, in characterizing the antigenic structure of the HA molecule, our approach has been (1) to generate a panel of monoclonal anti-HA hybridoma antibodies, (2) to use some of these antibodies to select mutants of the influenza A/PR/8/34 (PR8) virus expressing antigenically altered HA molecules, and (3) to construct an operational antigenic map of the HA molecule by comparative antigenic analysis of the mutant viruses with the monoclonal antibodies. As we report here, analysis of the 34 mutant viruses selected has enabled us to define four antigenic sites on the HA molecule. Our observation that these sites have undergone antigenic drift to a different extent in nature implies that the mechanisms responsible for antigenic drift act selectively on distinct structures of the HA molecule.",1981
s101977,isolation and partial nucleotide sequence of a cdna clone for human histocompatibility antigen hla-b by use of an oligodeoxynucleotide primer.,isolation and partial nucleotide sequence of a cdna clone for human histocompatibility antigen hla-b by use of an oligodeoxynucleotide primer.. We have isolated a cDNA clone for one of the HLA-B locus alloantigens by hybridization with a 30-nucleotide-long DNA probe. The probe was isolated from a reverse transcriptase (RNA-dependent DNA nucleotidyltransferase)-catalyzed cDNA synthesis reaction on poly(A)-mRNA in which an oligonucleotide (5'-32P)dC-T-T-C-T-C-C-A-C-A-TOH served as a primer and in which dideoxynucleoside triphosphates were used to reduce the size and heterogeneity of the cDNA products. The desired cDNA clone was isolated from a library of recombinant cDNA clones in the plasmid pBR322. The partial nucleotide sequence of the cDNA clone corresponds to the amino acid sequence of HLA-B7 antigen. The approach described in this paper is extremely sensitive and may be useful in cloning other genes for which the corresponding mRNA is present at low levels. This cDNA clone is nearly full length and can be used to isolate and to study the genes within the HLA region and to obtain expression of HLA-B peptides in cells.,1981
s102137,expression of antigenic determinants of the hemagglutinin gene of a human influenza virus in escherichia coli.,"expression of antigenic determinants of the hemagglutinin gene of a human influenza virus in escherichia coli.. Antigenic determinants of influenza virus hemagglutinin were expressed in Escherichia coli. DNA coding for presequences of hemagglutinin were removed and an ATG codon was placed before DNA coding for mature hemagglutinin. A number of expression plasmids were constructed in which various segments of this reconstructed hemagglutinin DNA were fused to DNA coding for bacterial beta-galactosidase. The fusion proteins exhibited specific binding to antiviral antibodies. This binding could be competitively inhibited by excess viral hemagglutinin, demonstrating that these fusion proteins contained antigenic determinants of hemagglutinin.",1981
s102284,construction of a potential bivalent vaccine strain: introduction of shigella sonnei form i antigen genes into the gale salmonella typhi ty21a typhoid vaccine strain.,"construction of a potential bivalent vaccine strain: introduction of shigella sonnei form i antigen genes into the gale salmonella typhi ty21a typhoid vaccine strain.. Shigella sonnei, an intestinal pathogen, produces a characteristic form I cell surface antigen now known to be plasmid encoded. We considered that the GalE Salmonella typhi Ty21a oral vaccine strain, highly effective against typhoid, might be modified so as to be protective also against shigellosis due to S. sonnei. The plasmid responsible for form I antigen synthesis was therefore conjugally transferred to the galE S. typhi strain. Serological studies revealed that the derivative strain produces the form I antigen in addition to the normal S. typhi somatic antigens. Testing in mice demonstrated that the derivative form I galE S. typhi strain is protective against both S. sonnei and S. typhi challenges. These data suggest that the galE S. Ty21a oral vaccine strain, which presumably stimulates the local immune system in the intestine, may also serve as a useful carrier for other antigenic determinants to protect against different intestinal infections.",1981
s102292,"repertoires of t cells directed against a large protein antigen, beta-galactosidase. i. helper cells have a more restricted specificity repertoire than proliferative cells.","repertoires of t cells directed against a large protein antigen, beta-galactosidase. i. helper cells have a more restricted specificity repertoire than proliferative cells.. The proliferative and helper T cell repertoires were compared in the CBA/J mouse for the response to the large protein antigen, tetrameric beta-galactosidase (GZ = 1021 a.a/monomer). The systems assessed the ability of cyanogen bromide (CB) peptides of GZ to: 1) prime for a T cell proliferative response to GZ; or 2) generate T cell help, measured by the production of anti-FITC PFC in the in vitro response to GZ-FITC. Priming for in vitro proliferation was attempted with 11 CB peptides comprising 70% of the GZ molecule. Strong priming was found with five peptides and intermediate priming was found with four other peptides; two peptides were without effect (CB-20 = a.a 767-862, and CB-4 = a.a. 188-202). Despite this indication of generally dispersed recognition of GZ epitopes, only two CB peptides, CB-2 (a.a. 3-92) and CB-10 (a.a. 378-418) were able to induce a T helper cell response. The surprising dearth of helper T cell-inducing epitopes may be peculiar to the limited fluorescein (FITC) substitution on GZ-FITC (17-25 FITC residues per tetramer) or it may reflect the constraints involved in T cell recognition required for T-B collaboration. Also considered was the possibility that the helper T cell repertoire might be distinct from the proliferative repertoire, the latter reflecting DNA synthesis and recruitment by other functional T cell subpopulations.",1982
s102350,antigen-induced b lymphocyte differentiation.,"antigen-induced b lymphocyte differentiation.. The analysis of B-lymphocyte activation has been a tantalizing prospect for both immunologists and cell biologists, as B cells have the unique characteristics of possessing a well-characterized receptor and displaying a clear inducible response to a specific antigen. As outlined in this review, we now know much about the cellular events which occur when mature B cell encounters antigen within the peripheral lymphoid organ of an immunocompetent host. Our understanding of the molecular events associated with these cellular processes is currently limited, but such information will undoubtedly ensue. The greatest challenges remaining in B-cell immunology are immunoregulation and an understanding of how the enormous B-cell specificity repertoire is generated. These challenges require greater insight into lymphocyte triggering events and the early events in B-cell maturation. This review has not restricted itself to the phenomena associated with antigen-triggered mature splenic B cells, but has attempted to include aspects of B-cell development which are often overlooked or disregarded. In particular, attention has been drawn to certain nonspecific antigen-induced B-cell events, and to antigen-initiated developmental processes which precede mature B-cell development. Additionally, the commitment of triggered mature B cells to effector cell production has been reconsidered in light of current attempts to propagate normal lymphocytes continuously and in a manner which avoids terminal differentiation. The availability of such lines, together with increasingly refined technology, will hopefully allow us to resolve the remaining mysteries in B-cell development.",1982
s102361,location and characterization of the antigenic portion of the fmdv immunizing protein.,"location and characterization of the antigenic portion of the fmdv immunizing protein.. Purified foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) to type O1K was treated with several endopeptidases of differing specificity. The immunizing protein VPThr was cleaved into two detectable fragments by all enzymes except for glutamic acid-specific Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. The longest fragments were generated by mouse submaxillary gland protease and the shortest by trypsin treatment of the intact virion. Several fragments, including the peptides resulting from the cyanogen bromide (CNBr) cleavage of the isolated protein VPThr were characterized in terms of their molecular weights N- and C-terminal amino acids, and ability to induce virus-specific antibodies. The order of the fragments along the protein was determined, and then located on the amino acid sequence of the protein. Two enzyme-sensitive areas of the protein were found on the surface of the virion: between sequence positions 138 and 154 and between portion 200 and the C terminus. Peptides containing these sections were able to induce neutralizing antibodies against the homologous FMDV. When the virus was treated with trypsin or with chymotrypsin, several amino acids between the detectable fragments were lost and the infectivity of the virus was reduced. The infectivity was retained, however, when the enzyme treatment resulted in cleavage of protein with no loss of amino acids or only the cutting away of the C-terminal section. These results suggest that the property of cell attachment is restricted to small regions of the surface of the virus particle.",1982
s102520,immune response to synthetic peptide analogues of hepatitis b surface antigen specific for the a determinant.,"immune response to synthetic peptide analogues of hepatitis b surface antigen specific for the a determinant.. Recovery from a natural infection with hepatitis B virus or vaccination with purified envelope protein leads to production of antibodies against the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Such physiologic response in man is generally directed against the a determinant of HBsAg common to all serotypes of the virus. To define the immunochemical specificity of this determinant, the secondary structure of HBsAg was derived from its sequence of 226 amino acids. Hydrophilic stretches expected to contain the antigenic determinants were located between residues 32 and 76 and between residues 110 and 156. Loss of the antigenic activity after chemical modification of lysine residues of HBsAg indicated their critical importance in antigenicity. Because all lysines are located between residues 121 and 160, we selected this region for localization of HbsAg determinants. Solid-phase synthesis was used to prepare seven peptide analogues of HBsAg (PsAs): 122-137, 128-134, 139-147, 139-158, 140-158, 145-158, and 150-158. For experimental immunization of rabbits the synthetic peptides were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. We studied the antigenicity of each peptide analogue by serologic neutralization of human antibodies specific for the a determinant of HBsAg. Analogues 139-147, 139-158, and 140-158 showed antigenicity as well as function of anti-HBsAg. The rabbit antibodies were inhibited with each of the three peptide analogues and all serotypes of natural HbSag, having only the a determinant in common. These results indicate that the nonapeptide sequence 139-147 represents the total or an essential part of the a determinant of HBsAg.",1982
s102533,the fine specificity of antigen and ia determinant recognition by t cell hybridoma clones specific for pigeon cytochrome c.,"the fine specificity of antigen and ia determinant recognition by t cell hybridoma clones specific for pigeon cytochrome c.. The activation of proliferative T lymphocytes normally involves the simultaneous recognition of a particular foreign antigen and a particular Ia molecule on the surface of antigen-presenting cells, the phenomenon of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restriction. An analysis of T cell clones specific for pigeon cytochrome c, from B10.A and B10.S(9R) strains of mice, revealed the unusual finding that several of the clones could respond to antigen in association with Ia molecules from either strain. Using these cross-reactive clones, we performed experiments which demonstrated that both the Ia molecule and the T cell receptor contribute to the specificity of antigen recognition; however, MHC-linked low responsiveness to tuna cytochrome c (an immune response gene defect) could not be attributed solely to the efficacy with which the Ia molecules associated with the antigen. These results imply that antigen and Ia molecules are not recognized independently, but must interact at least during the process of T cell activation.",1982
s102663,characterization of an antigenic determinant of the glycoprotein that correlates with pathogenicity of rabies virus.,"characterization of an antigenic determinant of the glycoprotein that correlates with pathogenicity of rabies virus.. The pathogenicity of fixed rabies virus strains for adult mice depends on the presence of an antigenic determinant on the viral glycoprotein. Two virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies have been used to identify this determinant. All pathogenic strains of fixed rabies virus bind to these antibodies and are neutralized by them, whereas nonpathogenic strains fail to react with these monoclonal antibodies and are not neutralized by them. Antigenic variants of the rabies virus with altered glycoprotein were selected by growing virus in the presence of one monoclonal antibody, 194-2. All variants that lost their ability to react with this antibody and an additional antibody, 248-8, were found to be nonpathogenic for adult mice. Analysis of tryptic peptides of the glycoproteins of pathogenic parent virus and nonpathogenic variants and the amino acid sequence of a specific variant tryptic peptide revealed that the change in pathogenicity corresponded to an amino acid substitution at position 333 of the glycoprotein molecule. The nucleotide sequence of the nonpathogenic variant glycoprotein gene contained a base change that confirmed the single amino acid substitution in the tryptic peptide replacing arginine-333 in the parental glycoprotein. We conclude that arginine-333 is essential for the integrity of an antigenic determinant and for the ability of rabies viruses to produce lethal infection in adult mice.",1983
s102730,monoclonal antibodies for carcinoembryonic antigen and related antigens as a model system: determination of affinities and specificities of monoclonal antibodies by using biotin-labeled antibodies and avidin as precipitating agent in a solution phase immunoassay.,"monoclonal antibodies for carcinoembryonic antigen and related antigens as a model system: determination of affinities and specificities of monoclonal antibodies by using biotin-labeled antibodies and avidin as precipitating agent in a solution phase immunoassay.. A general method is described for the determination of affinity constants and antigen cross-reactivities of monoclonal antibodies. The method employs biotin-labeled antibody, radiolabeled antigen, and avidin as a precipitating agent in a homogeneous phase, competitive radioimmunoassay. This method eliminates incomplete or variable precipitation of antigen-antibody complexes often encountered in immunoassays in which monoclonal antibodies are employed. Using this assay system, we were able to rapidly determine the affinity constants for a number of monoclonal antibodies elicited to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). In the preceding paper it was shown that five of the monoclonal antibodies recognized distinct epitopes on CEA. In antigen-binding experiments with these five monoclonal antibodies, the percent of radiolabeled CEA bound in antibody excess ranged from 30 to 92%. The CEA cross-reacting antigens, normal cross-reacting antigen (NCA), and tumor-extracted, CEA-related antigen (TEX) were significantly bound by one, and to a lesser degree, by two of the five antibodies. Two antibodies did not bind significant amounts of NCA or TEX. In inhibition studies, the amount of unlabeled CEA leading to 50% inhibition of 125I-labeled CEA-binding was in the range of 3.7 to 760 ng per tube. The amount of TEX showing the same degree of inhibition was 23-fold greater than the amount of CEA for two antibodies and 351-fold greater than the amount of CEA for a third antibody. The affinity constants for CEA were in the range of 1.0 x 10(8) to 5.1 x 10(10) M-1. The affinity constants for NCA and TEX, determined for one of the antibodies, were three orders of magnitude lower in comparison to CEA. The heterogeneity of radiolabeled CEA as indicated by the low fraction bound by one of the monoclonal antibodies is shown to be most probably an artifact resulting from radioiodination damage. The application of the approach described in this report should eliminate the problems most commonly encountered in the determination of affinity constants for monoclonal antibodies or the use of monoclonal antibodies in competitive, homogeneous-phase immunoassays.",1983
s102735,escape of mouse mastocytoma p815 after nearly complete rejection is due to antigen-loss variants rather than immunosuppression.,"escape of mouse mastocytoma p815 after nearly complete rejection is due to antigen-loss variants rather than immunosuppression.. Even though mastocytoma P815 often undergoes a nearly complete rejection in syngeneic mice, the tumor cells almost always escape to form progressive tumors. We found that this was not due to the establishment of an immunosuppressed state because genetically marked P815 cells, that were injected in mice where tumor escape was occurring, were readily rejected. An analysis of escaping tumor cell populations with anti-P815 cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones showed the presence of stable resistant variants. Using antigen-loss variants found in escaping populations or selected in vitro with CTL clones, we were able to define four different tumor-associated antigenic specificities, each recognized by a specific CTL clone. One of these specificities was absent from all escaping tumor cells and another had been lost by some of them.",1983
s102759,chemically synthesized peptides of hepatitis b surface antigen duplicate the d/y specificities and induce subtype-specific antibodies in chimpanzees.,"chemically synthesized peptides of hepatitis b surface antigen duplicate the d/y specificities and induce subtype-specific antibodies in chimpanzees.. Synthetic peptides, predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the S gene of hepatitis B virus were analyzed in terms of the established specificities of the hepatitis B surface antigen. The analysis indicated that the group-specific alpha antigen is composed of at least three nonoverlapping sequences and that a relatively hydrophilic region of the surface antigen protein, spanning amino acid residues 110-137, specifies the major d and y subtype system. The d/y subtype appears to depend on changes in one or more variable amino acids at positions 127, 131, and 134 of the hepatitis B surface antigen protein. Peptide 49 (consisting of amino acid sequences of the y subtype for the region 110-137), coupled to a carrier protein and mixed with an adjuvant, stimulated a brisk anti-y response in chimpanzees, the relevant model of human response to hepatitis B virus immunization and infection. Experimental challenge with homologous hepatitis B virus resulted in a pattern of partial protection. The results offer promise for the application of chemically synthesized peptides as vaccines in the prophylaxis of hepatitis B virus disease.",1983
s102815,immunochemical structure of hepatitis b e antigen in the serum.,"immunochemical structure of hepatitis b e antigen in the serum.. Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) constitutes the nucleocapsid of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and occurs in association with plasma proteins, particularly with IgG, in the serum of persons infected with the virus. A polypeptide with an approximate m.w. of 15,500 (P15.5) is obtained either from HBeAg in the serum or from the nucleocapsid of HBV. P15.5 preparations from serum and virus resembled closely each other in the amino acid composition. The C-terminus amino acid sequence of P15.5 from serum was determined to be -Thr-Thr-Val-Val, whereas that from the virus ended with -Thr-Thr. The same sequence of four amino acid residues was found on the gene coding for the nucleopeptide of hepatitis B virus with a molecular size of 19,000 daltons (P19). P15.5 identified on the nucleotide sequence of P19 was composed of 149 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular size of 16,770 daltons. The gene coding for P19 had two -Asp-Pro-connections. By splitting these connections in P19 and P15.5 preparations with formic acid, smaller polypeptides were obtained with sizes predicted from the nucleotide sequence and with the N-terminus amino acid of proline as expected. One of two monoclonal antibodies raised against the core of Dane particles (HBcAg) bound with P15.5 preparations purified from serum and HBV. The IgG fraction from a human serum containing antibodies to HBcAg but not to HBeAg bound with P15.5 also. On the basis of the results obtained, the IgG molecules associated with P15.5 in the serum of persons infected with HBV may well represent the antibodies against HBcAg with limited specificities.",1983
s103202,plasmodium knowlesi sporozoite antigen: expression by infectious recombinant vaccinia virus.,"plasmodium knowlesi sporozoite antigen: expression by infectious recombinant vaccinia virus.. The gene coding for the circumsporozoite antigen of the malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi was inserted into the vaccinia virus genome under the control of a defined vaccinia virus promoter. Cells infected with the recombinant virus synthesized polypeptides of 53,000 to 56,000 daltons that reacted with monoclonal antibody against the repeating epitope of the malaria protein. Furthermore, rabbits vaccinated with the recombinant virus produced antibodies that bound specifically to sporozoites. These data provide evidence for expression of a cloned malaria gene in mammalian cells and illustrate the potential of vaccinia virus recombinants as live malaria vaccines.",1984
s103245,domain interactions of h-2 class i antigens alter cytotoxic t-cell recognition sites.,"domain interactions of h-2 class i antigens alter cytotoxic t-cell recognition sites.. H-2 class I antigens appear to direct the recognition of virus-infected and neoplastic transformed cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Here, to identify the regions of class I antigens involved in CTL recognition, four hybrid class I genes were constructed in which exons were exchanged between the H-2Kb and H-2Db genes. These class I genes were expressed in mouse L cells and recognition of the hybrid Kb/Db antigens by CTLs and monoclonal antibodies specific for either Kb or Db was investigated. The pattern of CTL and monoclonal antibody recognition obtained indicates three correlations between structure and function of class I antigens. First, most CTL recognition sites and alloantigenic determinants are located on domains 1 and 2 of the antigen molecule. Second, these CTL recognition sites and alloantigenic determinants are not influenced by interaction of domains 1 and 2 with polymorphic regions of domain 3. Third, in contrast, interaction between domains 1 and 2 alters these CTL recognition sites and alloantigenic determinants. The alteration of CTL recognition sites by interaction between domains 1 and 2 suggests that a CTL site may be formed by amino acids from both domains 1 and 2, or that the conformation of amino acids at a CTL site may be altered by interactions between domains 1 and 2. Through these two features, the conformation of CTL recognition sites on H-2 class I antigens may be sensitive to alteration by interaction of either domain 1 or 2 with viral antigens.",1984
s103247,stimulation of simian virus 40 late gene expression by simian virus 40 tumor antigen.,"stimulation of simian virus 40 late gene expression by simian virus 40 tumor antigen.. The early simian virus 40 (SV40) gene product, large tumor (T) antigen, is responsible for the initiation of viral DNA replication and the autoregulation of early gene expression through direct protein-DNA interactions. We investigated the role of T antigen in late viral gene expression, independent of its function in amplifying templates through DNA replication. SV40 DNA was transfected into BSC-1 and COS-1 cells and cultured in the presence of inhibitors of DNA replication. Electrophoretic immunoblot analysis indicated that both the onset and the extent of SV40 late gene expression is increased in COS-1 cells, which constitutively express SV40 T antigen. Blot hybridization analysis of poly(A)-selected RNA demonstrated that the level of synthesis of the major late structural protein VP-1 in COS-1 cells was due to increased transcription. Similar results were obtained when plasmids that contain the SV40 late gene but lack both the origin for viral DNA replication and the early gene coding region were transfected onto COS-1 cells. Using lines of SV40-transformed monkey kidney cells that express altered T antigens, we found that enhanced expression of the late gene product is correlated with the ability of T antigen to bind SV40 DNA. These results indicate that large T antigen plays a role in the stimulation of late viral gene expression.",1984
s103257,a hodgkin cell-specific antigen is expressed on a subset of auto- and alloactivated t (helper) lymphoblasts.,"a hodgkin cell-specific antigen is expressed on a subset of auto- and alloactivated t (helper) lymphoblasts.. A Hodgkin cell-specific antigen detected by the monoclonal antibody Ki-1 was found on T helper lymphocytes after activation by autologous and allogeneic stimulator cells. About 50% of lymphoblasts generated by auto- and alloactivation reacted with the antibody. In contrast, only less than 6% of lymphoblasts stimulated with Con-A, phytohemagglutinin (PHA), or protein A, and none of lymphoblasts activated by oxidative mitogenesis, expressed this antigen. Among several permanent cell lines tested, the K562, MOLT-4, HL-60, and EBV transformed B lymphoblastoid cells reacted with the Ki-1 antibody. The results may indicate possible relationships between the autoreactive subset of T lymphocytes and the pathogenesis of Hodgkin's disease.",1984

A panel of mouse hybridomas secreting monoclonal antibody to serum hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) was produced from mice immunized with denatured hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg). This panel could be divided broadly into two groups. Within each group, the monoclonal antibodies recognized a single antigenic site, designated either e-alpha or e-beta, and generally exhibited a high degree of cross-inhibition. In contrast, between the two groups of antibodies there was little or no cross-inhibition. The antigens of serum HBeAg and denatured HBcAg appeared to be very similar. Both behaved as molecules carrying only a single e-alpha or e-beta site, in spite of native serum HBeAg having an apparent molecular weight of 300 000. It is inferred that e-alpha and e-beta sites may be involved in the polymerization of HBeAg into HBcAg and that during this process mutual masking of antigenic sites may occur.",1984
s103280,"complete nucleotide sequences of all three poliovirus serotype genomes. implication for genetic relationship, gene function and antigenic determinants.","complete nucleotide sequences of all three poliovirus serotype genomes. implication for genetic relationship, gene function and antigenic determinants.. The complete nucleotide sequences of the genomes of the type 2 ( P712 , Ch, 2ab ) and type 3 (Leon 12a1b ) poliovirus vaccine strains were determined. Comparison of the sequences with the previously established genome sequence of type 1 (LS-c, 2ab ) poliovirus vaccine strain revealed that 71% of the nucleotides in the genome RNAs were common, that the 5' and 3' termini of the genomes were highly homologous, and that more than 80% of the nucleotide differences in the coding region occurred in the third letter position of in-phase codons, resulting in a low frequency of amino acid difference. These results strongly suggested that the serotypes of poliovirus derived from a common prototype. A comparison of the amino acid sequences predicted from the genome sequences showed highest variation in the capsid protein region, whereas non-structural proteins are highly conserved. Initiation of polyprotein synthesis occurs in all three strains more than 740 nucleotides downstream from the 5' end. An analysis of the non-coding region suggests that small peptides that could potentially originate from this region are conserved. The amino acid sequences immediately surrounding the cleavage signals, however, show a higher than average degree of variation. The analysis of the amino acid sequences of the capsid protein VP1 of all serotypes has led to the prediction of potential antigenic sites on the virion involved in neutralization.",1984
s103283,"isolation, characterization, and physical mapping of a pseudorabies virus mutant containing antigenically altered gp50.","isolation, characterization, and physical mapping of a pseudorabies virus mutant containing antigenically altered gp50.. A pseudorabies virus variant ( mar197 -1) containing a mutation in a viral glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 50,000 ( gp50 ) was isolated by selecting for resistance to a neurtralizing monoclonal antibody ( MCA50 -1) directed against gp50 . This mutant was completely resistant to neutralization with MCA50 -1 in the presence or absence of complement, and was therefore defined as a mar (monoclonal-antibody-resistant) mutant. The mutation did not affect neutralization with polyvalent immune serum. The mar197 -1 mutant synthesized and processed gp50 normally, but the mutation prevented the binding and immunoprecipitation of gp50 by MCA50 -1. Thus, the mutation was within the structural portion of the gp50 gene affecting the epitope of the monoclonal antibody. The mutation was mapped by marker rescue with cloned pseudorabies restriction enzyme fragments to the short region of the pseudorabies genome between 0.813 and 0.832 map units. This is equivalent to a 2.1-kilobase-pair region.",1984
s103295,method to map antigenic determinants recognized by monoclonal antibodies: localization of a determinant of virus neutralization on the feline leukemia virus envelope protein gp70.,"method to map antigenic determinants recognized by monoclonal antibodies: localization of a determinant of virus neutralization on the feline leukemia virus envelope protein gp70.. A method is presented whereby antigenic determinants recognized by specific monoclonal antibodies can be mapped to specific sites on a protein sequence with high resolution. Short DNase I-generated DNA fragments encoding portions of the protein of interest are molecularly cloned into the EcoRI site of the beta-galactosidase gene of phage lambda Charon 16 so as to obtain expression of random protein fragments as fusion proteins. The monoclonal antibody is used to screen the phage library to isolate phage expressing the specific antigenic determinant. DNA of immunoreactive phage can be analyzed rapidly and subcloned to allow DNA sequence determination. The method is generally applicable and permits antigenic determinants of functionally interesting monoclonal antibodies to be mapped and related to specific protein sequences. We have used this procedure to determine the region of the feline leukemia virus envelope protein gp70 recognized by a virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibody, cl.25. Antibody binding was mapped to a 14-amino acid region in the amino-terminal half of gp70. This region may be directly involved in an essential function of the gp70 protein, perhaps in gp70-mediated host recognition functions. Synthetic peptides derived from this region may provide useful vaccine antigens for the prevention of feline leukemia virus-associated disease in cats.",1984
s103330,measles virus-specific t4+ human cytotoxic t cell clones are restricted by class ii hla antigens.,"measles virus-specific t4+ human cytotoxic t cell clones are restricted by class ii hla antigens.. We have generated measles virus-specific T cell clones from a patient with multiple sclerosis who has been described previously as a strong responder to measles virus. T cell clones were screened on the basis of their capacity to proliferate to measles virus. The cell surface phenotype of each clone was OKT3+, OKT4+, OKT8-. The majority of these clones (11 of 14) were cytotoxic for their autologous measles virus-infected lymphoblastoid B cell target. This cytotoxicity was specific for measles virus inasmuch as these T cell clones could not lyse influenza or mumps virus-infected B cell targets. By using a panel of HLA-defined measles virus-infected B cell lines, these clones were shown to recognize measles virus in the context of HLA class II determinants. A monoclonal antibody that recognizes HLA class II monomorphic determinants (L243), but not a monoclonal antibody that recognizes HLA class I antigens (W6/32), inhibited the lysis of the autologous measles virus-infected B cell target by these T cell clones. These results demonstrate that these cytotoxic T cell clones specific for measles virus are HLA class II restricted.",1984
s103340,structure of the gene encoding the immunodominant surface antigen on the sporozoite of the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum.,"structure of the gene encoding the immunodominant surface antigen on the sporozoite of the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum.. The gene for the circumsporozoite (CS) protein of Plasmodium falciparum has been cloned and its nucleotide sequence determined. The gene encodes a protein of 412 amino acids as deduced from the nucleotide sequence. The protein contains 41 tandem repeats of a tetrapeptide, 37 of which are Asn-Ala-Asn-Pro and four of which are Asn-Val-Asp-Pro. Monoclonal antibodies against the CS protein of Plasmodium falciparum were inhibited from binding to the protein by synthetic peptides of the repeat sequence. The CS protein of Plasmodium falciparum and the CS protein of a simian malaria parasite, Plasmodium knowlesi, have two regions of homology, one of which is present on either side of the repeat. One region contains 12 of 13 identical amino acids. Within the nucleotide sequence of this region, 25 of 27 nucleotides are conserved. The conservation of these regions in parasites widely separated in evolution suggests that they may have a function such as binding to liver cells and may represent an invariant target for immunity.",1984
s103351,the structure of an antigenic determinant in a protein.,"the structure of an antigenic determinant in a protein.. The immunogenic and antigenic determinants of a synthetic peptide and the corresponding antigenic determinants in the parent protein have been elucidated. Four determinants have been defined by reactivity of a large panel of antipeptide monoclonal antibodies with short, overlapping peptides (7-28 amino acids), the immunizing peptide (36 amino acids), and the intact parent protein (the influenza virus hemagglutinin, HA). The majority of the antipeptide antibodies that also react strongly with the intact protein recognize one specific nine amino acid sequence. This immunodominant peptide determinant is located in the subunit interface in the HA trimeric structure. The relative inaccessibility of this site implies that antibody binding to the protein is to a more unfolded HA conformation. This antigenic determinant differs from those previously described for the hemagglutinin and clearly demonstrates the ability of synthetic peptides to generate antibodies that interact with regions of the protein not immunogenic or generally accessible when the protein is the immunogen.",1984
s103471,antigenic structures of proteins. their determination has revealed important aspects of immune recognition and generated strategies for synthetic mimicking of protein binding sites.,"antigenic structures of proteins. their determination has revealed important aspects of immune recognition and generated strategies for synthetic mimicking of protein binding sites.. Studies in this laboratory have resulted in the delineation and synthetic verification of several complete protein antigenic structures that are recognized by antibodies. More recently, for the first time, the full profiles of the sites that are recognized by T cells have been localized and confirmed by synthesis for two proteins, myoglobin and lysozyme. These have thus far constituted the only complete antigenic structures to be determined. The availability of these antigenic structures has enabled us to investigate in detail the molecular and cellular parameters responsible for immune recognition, responses to, and control and regulation of these responses to protein antigens at the molecular and submolecular levels. Moreover, these investigations have afforded general strategies for the synthetic mimicking of not only antigenic sites, but also protein binding sites involved in other biological activities.",1984
s103641,haplotype-specific suppression of cytotoxic t cell induction by antigen inappropriately presented on t cells.,"haplotype-specific suppression of cytotoxic t cell induction by antigen inappropriately presented on t cells.. To detect a strong cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to minor histocompatibility (H) antigens in a 5-d mixed lymphocyte culture, it is necessary to use a responder that has been primed in vivo with antigen-bearing cells. It has previously been shown that minor-H-specific CTL can be primed in vivo both directly by foreign spleen cells and by presentation of foreign minor H antigens on host antigen-presenting cells. This latter route is evident in the phenomenon of cross-priming, in which H-2 heterozygous (A x B)F1 mice injected 2 wk previously with minor H-different H-2A (A') spleen cells generate both H-2A- and H-2B-restricted minor-H-specific CTL. In a study of the kinetics of direct- vs. cross-priming to minors in F1 mice, we have found that minor H-different T cells actually suppress the induction of virgin CTL capable of recognizing them. CTL activity measured from F1 mice 3-6 d after injection with viable A' spleen cells is largely H-2B restricted. The H-2A-restricted response recovers such that roughly equal A- and B-restricted activity is detected in mice as early as 8-10 d postinjection. This temporary hyporeactivity does not result from generalized immunosuppression--it is specific for those CTL that recognize the foreign minor H antigen in the context of the H-2 antigens on the injected spleen cells. The injected spleen cells that mediate this suppression are radiosensitive T cells; Lyt-2+ T cells are highly efficient at suppressing the induction of CTL in vivo. No graft vs. host reaction by the injected T cells appears to be required, as suppression of direct primed CTL can be mediated by spleen cells that are wholly tolerant of both host H-2 and minor H antigens. Suppression cannot be demonstrated by in vitro mixing experiments. Several possible mechanisms for haplotype-specific suppression are discussed, including inactivation of responding CTL by veto cells and in vivo sequestration of responding CTL by the injected spleen cells.",1983
s103646,suppression of cell-mediated lymphocytotoxicity against minor histocompatibility antigens mediated by lyt-1+lyt-2+ t cells of stimulator-strain origin.,"suppression of cell-mediated lymphocytotoxicity against minor histocompatibility antigens mediated by lyt-1+lyt-2+ t cells of stimulator-strain origin.. Cultured, unprimed spleen cells suppress the generation of cytolytic T lymphocytes when added to mixed lymphocyte culture of cells disparate at minor histocompatibility (H) loci. Cells cultured for 2 to 3 days inhibit cell-mediated lympholysis specifically in that they suppress only when they carry the same H antigen by which the stimulators activate the responding cells. However, culturing of cells for more than 3 days results also in the generation of nonspecific suppressor cells which inhibit the cell-mediated lympholysis regardless whether they carry the stimulating antigens. The specific suppressor cells are T lymphocytes of the Lyt-1+Lyt-2+ type. Fresh, uncultured spleen cells, although ineffective in vitro, can prevent the in vivo priming of minor H-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors when injected i.v. into mice incompatible at minor H loci. This suppressive effect of the immunizing inoculum is abolished by irradiation (3300 rds) or by treatment with a monoclonal Thy-1-specific antibody and complement. Thus the suppressor T cell demonstrated here is of the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""veto"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" cell type; that is, it probably suppresses minor H-specific cells when the latter recognize the stimulating antigen on the surface of the suppressor cell itself.",1982
s103931,the augmentation of tumor-specific immunity by virus help. ii. enhanced induction of cytotoxic t lymphocyte and antibody responses to tumor antigens by vaccinia virus-reactive helper t cells.,"the augmentation of tumor-specific immunity by virus help. ii. enhanced induction of cytotoxic t lymphocyte and antibody responses to tumor antigens by vaccinia virus-reactive helper t cells.. The present study investigates the role of vaccinia virus-reactive helper T cells in causing enhanced induction of syngeneic tumor immunity. Vaccinia virus-reactive helper T cell activity capable of inducing the augmented generation of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) or antibody responses was generated in C3H/HeN mice by inoculating i.p. live virus. Immunization of these mice with vaccinia virus-infected syngeneic X5563 plasmacytoma or MH134 hapatoma cells led to augmented induction of immune resistance against the challenge with corresponding viable tumor cells when compared with the incidence of resistance observed in control mice not primed to vaccinia virus. In vitro cytotoxicity tests utilizing spleen cells and serum from mice which resulted in the augmented tumor resistance by virus help have revealed that spleen cells from C3H/HeN mice immune to the X5563 plasmacytoma exhibited appreciable anti-X5563 CTL activity, whereas serum from these mice failed to display any antibody response. In contrast, MH134-immune mice exhibited potent anti-MH134 antibody, but not CTL responses. Such an anti-tumor CTL or antibody response augmented by vaccinia virus-reactive helper T cells was found to be tumor specific. These results are discussed in the context of (a) the functional diversity of tumor antigens, and (b) mechanisms of virus help that are involved in various forms of augmented induction of syngeneic tumor immunity.",1984
s103937,"class 1 (unique) tumor antigens of human melanoma. identification of a 90,000 dalton cell surface glycoprotein by autologous antibody.","class 1 (unique) tumor antigens of human melanoma. identification of a 90,000 dalton cell surface glycoprotein by autologous antibody.. Analysis of the humoral immune response of patients with melanoma has identified a small group of individuals with antibody to cell surface antigens that are restricted to autologous melanoma cells. These antigens, referred to as Class I or unique tumor antigens, are demonstrated by reactions between serum and cultured melanoma cells from the same patient and absorption tests with autologous and allogeneic normal and malignant cells to determine antibody specificity. Five Class 1 melanoma antigens have been defined to date, but insight into the nature of these antigens has been limited because antibodies identifying these antigens lacked detectable immunoprecipitating activity. We have now defined a Class 1 melanoma antigen (designated FD) that is immunoprecipitated by autologous antibody. FD antigen is identified by an IgG antibody present in the sera of patient FD, and peak titers of this antibody in tests with cultured autologous melanoma cells are in the range of 1:2048. By absorption tests, FD antigen could not be detected on any other cell type, including 33 allogeneic melanomas. Prolonged culture of FD melanoma cells resulted in decreased expression of FD antigen, but sublines could be obtained with stable antigen expression. FD antigen is trypsin and heat sensitive, neuraminidase resistant, and is shed in the culture medium. Immunoprecipitation of 125I-labeled cell membrane preparations revealed a 90,000 dalton component of pI 5.5. Serum immunoprecipitating activity could be absorbed by autologous melanoma cells but not by autologous B cells or allogeneic cell lines. A component of the same molecular mass could be precipitated from lysates of cells metabolically labeled with [3H]mannose. The membrane form of the FD antigen binds strongly to Con A-Sepharose and can be eluted with methyl-alpha-D-mannoside. The identification of a precipitating Class I antigenic system of melanoma facilitates efforts to generate monoclonal antibodies to this tumor antigen and to clone its coding sequence.",1984
s104000,elimination of serum proteins and potential virus contaminants during hepatitis b vaccine preparation.,"elimination of serum proteins and potential virus contaminants during hepatitis b vaccine preparation.. As first generation hepatitis B vaccines are derived from human plasma, detailed information is required concerning the elimination of hepatitis B virus and other potential transmissible infectious agents during vaccine preparation. To demonstrate the safety of a hepatitis B vaccine, the efficiency of each of the six main steps used in the preparation process to remove or destroy pathogens was determined for representatives of major groups of animal viruses. Infectivity of all the tested viruses was reduced 10(5)-fold to a factor of 10(9)-fold by the first and last steps, namely PEG fractionation and formalin treatment. The four successive zonal ultracentrifugations decreased virus infectivity by at least 10(7)-fold. Five of these steps tend also to purify the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) which increases the HBsAg: protein ratio by at least 10(5)-fold. Considering the high degree of purity obtained, checked on each batch, it is concluded that the procedure consistently eliminates any potential virus with a ide safety margin.",1984
s104283,genetic and physical evidence for plasmid control of shigella sonnei form i cell surface antigen.,"genetic and physical evidence for plasmid control of shigella sonnei form i cell surface antigen.. Virulent Shigella sonnei synthesize a surface antigen (form I) which appears to be one of several requirements needed for this host to invade epithelial cells. Upon restreaking on agar media, form I cells readily and irreversibly generate form II cells that lack the form I antigen. All form II cells are avirulent. Plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid of form I and II cells of four different S. sonnei isolates, obtained from different areas of the world, was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. A large plasmid (approximately 120 megadaltons in three of the strains) that is present in form I cells was always absent from form II derivatives. Attempts to transfer conjugally only this large plasmid from form I to genetically marked form II cells were unsuccessful. However, a composite molecule, apparently formed by recombination between the large form I plasmid and a self-transmissible plasmid, was found to transfer the form I trait. Transconjugant S. sonnei strains acquiring the form I antigen could retransfer this trait to S. sonnei, Shigella flexneri, or Salmonella typhi. These preliminary findings demonstrate that S. sonnei form I antigen synthesis is mediated by a large plasmid which is lost spontaneously at a relatively high frequency from S. sonnei strains.",1980
s104486,antibodies specific for the carboxy- and amino-terminal regions of simian virus 40 large tumor antigen.,"antibodies specific for the carboxy- and amino-terminal regions of simian virus 40 large tumor antigen.. Antibodies specific for the amino- and carboxy-terminal portions of simian virus 40 large tumor (T) antigen were obtained by immunization of rabbits with synthetic peptides corresponding to these regions. The amino-terminal synthetic peptide has the sequence Ac-Met-Asp-Lys-Val-Leu-Asn-Arg-(Tyr). The tyrosine residue was introduced in order to couple the peptide to bovine serum albumin with bis-diazotized benzidine. The carboxy-terminal peptide has the sequence Lys-Pro-Pro-Thr-Pro-Pro-Pro-Glu-Pro-Glu-Thr. It was coupled to bovine serum albumin with glutaraldehyde. The antisera against both peptides reacted with large T antigen. The specificity of the immune reaction was demonstrated by inhibition experiments using excess synthetic peptides. Furthermore, fragments of T antigen encoded by the nondefective adenovirus 2-simian virus 40 hybrid viruses Ad2+ND2 and Ad2+ND4, which contain the carboxy terminus and lack the amino terminus of large T antigen, were precipitated only with antiserum to the carboxy-terminal peptide. Small T antigen was not precipitated with either serum, suggesting that the amino terminus of small T antigen has a conformation different from that of large T antigen or that it is sterically hindered by a host protein. The procedures used here are of general importance for identification and characterization of gene product.",1980
s104811,d-antigen determination in polio vaccine production: comparison of gel diffusion and elisa methods.,"d-antigen determination in polio vaccine production: comparison of gel diffusion and elisa methods.. Up to now gel diffusion is widely used for in vitro determination of polio D-antigen. This method has several disadvantages, its relatively low sensitivity being the main one. Generally samples have to be concentrated, which requires fairly large amounts of material and often results in some loss of antigen due to adsorption. Two ELISA methods have been developed for determination of polio D-antigen. These tests have a high sensitivity, approximately 1 DU/ml, and require very small amounts of sample and antisera. Using the indirect method only one HRPO conjugated antiserum is needed for quantitation of type 1, 2 and 3 D-antigen. Comparison of D-antigen values obtained by ELISA and gel diffusion for a number of vaccines revealed a good correlation between the different methods. The indirect ELISA method has also been applied successfully for D-antigen quantitation of A1PO4 adsorbed DT-and DPT-polio vaccines.",1981

An adenovirus-SV40 recombinant has been constructed in which the SV40 early region, joined to a copy of the adenovirus major late promoter, was substituted for a small portion of the adenovirus late region and all of early region 3. The inserted sequence functions as a separate transcriptional unit, using the ectopic adenovirus promoter, SV40 splice sites and SV40 polyadenylation site. The RNAs produced lack both the second and third members of the tripartite leader normally found on adenovirus late RNA, yet are translationally active, directing the synthesis of substantial amounts of SV40 T antigen. The recombinant may serve as a model vehicle for the abundant expression of other eucaryotic genes inserted into the adenovirus genome.",1981

Cytomegalovirus-specific lymphocyte proliferation and immunofluorescent antibody responses were measured serially in five normal adults and eight candidates for renal transplant immunized with Towne strain cytomegalovirus vaccine. All of the normal adults developed cellular and humoral immune responses. Five of the eight immunized renal transplant candidates developed proliferative responses comparable to those of normal adults, although in two instances maximal responses were delayed. Vaccinees developed proliferative responses to antigens prepared from the Towne strain as well as heterologous strains of cytomegalovirus. The appearance of immunofluorescent antibodies was generally delayed for the renal transplant candidates, and two of the individuals who had poor proliferative responses also had low antibody titers.",1981

The immunogenicity and safety of 3 serials of a canine parainfluenza (CPI) virus-Bordetella bronchiseptica vaccine was evaluated. Each serial was used to vaccinate 10 dogs with single doses given intranasally. The 30 vaccinated and 10 nonvaccinated controls dogs were challenge exposed with aerosols of virulent CPI virus and B bronchiseptica at 18 days and at 21 days, respectively, after vaccination. After challenge exposure, none of the 30 vaccinated dogs had clinical signs of disease; however, 9 of the 10 nonvaccinated dogs developed coughing problems. The CPI virus was isolated from nasal swab specimens obtained from nonvaccinated dogs on an average of 5.1 days after challenge exposure, but was not isolated from any of the specimens obtained from the vaccinated dogs. Bordetella bronchiseptica was isolated from nasal swab specimens obtained from both vaccinated and nonvaccinated dogs up to 18 days after challenge exposure. The erythrocyte sedimentation rates and total leukocyte counts for control dogs were generally increased, in contrast to those for the vaccinated groups. Dogs showed a primary serologic response to CPI virus and B bronchiseptica after vaccination and an anamnestic response to the bacterium after challenge exposure. Adverse local or systemic reactions attributable to the bivalent vaccine were not observed in the vaccinated dogs.",1981

We analyzed the DNA binding properties of wild-type simian virus 40 large T antigen and found that the protein binds cooperatively to three tandem sites at a regulatory region of SV40 DNA. One consequence of this T antigen:DNA interaction is the specific repression of SV40 early RNA synthesis in vitro.

To determine how T antigen interacts with its binding sites to repress RNA synthesis, we analyzed transcription directed by a variety of wild-type, mutant and hybrid template DNAs. Our findings suggest that the cooperative binding of T antigen to its sites is directly responsible for inhibiting the initiation, rather than blocking elongation, of early RNA synthesis. A model is presented to explain the role of T antigen binding in the regulation of viral transcription and DNA replication during SV40 lytic infection.",1981

All cells that harbor the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome contain a neoantigen in the nucleus (EBNA). By transfection we located a segment of the genome that encodes or induces an antigen serologically related to EBNA. The responsible genes are found in the 3.4-megaldalton BamHI fragment K of EBV DNA, specifically in the left 1.9 megadaltons represented by HindIII fragment I1. Mouse LTK- cells were cotransformed with recombinant plasmids, containing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene and either EcoRI fragment B or BamHI fragment of K of EBV DNA. The TK+ cells surviving in selective medium were cloned. About 50% of the clones expressed the neoantigen in every nucleus. These mouse cells were used as antigens in immunofluorescence tests. Antibody to the nuclear antigen was found in 30 human sera known to contain antibody to EBNA; it was not detected in 18 sera that did not have antibody to EBNA. Mouse cells expressing EBNA as the result of acquisition of cloned EBV DNA fragments should prove useful in the characterization of the structure of this antigen and as reagents for the diagnosis of EBV infections.",1982

By using a new host-vector system, expression of the gene coding for hepatitis B surface antigen has been studied. A subgenomic fragment of cloned hepatitis B viral DNA was inserted into the plasmid vector pSV010.

s106571,plasmid-directed synthesis of hepatitis b surface antigen in monkey cells.,"plasmid-directed synthesis of hepatitis b surface antigen in monkey cells.. We introduced the gene encoding the hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) into simian virus 40 (SV40)-based plasmids capable of autonomously replicating in both Escherichia coli and permissive monkey cells. After introduction into monkey cells by transfection, these plasmids directed the synthesis of high levels of HBsAg, as determined by immunofluorescence, radioimmunoassays, and identification by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the polypeptides comprising the antigen. Expression was dependent upon the presence of an SV40 promoter, with both the early and late promoters able to effectively initiate transcription. Using expression of HBsAg to assay promoter function, we demonstrated that an intact copy of the SV40 72-base pair repeat, which constitutes an essential element of the SV40 early promoter during the lytic SV40 cycle and which can enhance the transcriptional activity of heterologous promoters, was not required for HBsAg expression, suggesting that the hepatitis genome contains an enhancer element capable of complementing that provided by the 72-base pair repeat element of SV40. The antigen appears to be glycosylated after synthesis in transfected cells and is apparently secreted, as evidenced by the localization of [35S]cysteine-labeled antigen to the medium of transfected cultures. Using constructions in which the first ATG sequence appearing in HBsAg mRNA was that corresponding to the gene encoding the mature form of the antigen, we demonstrated that these post-translational events could occur without the involvement of a putative precursor peptide suggested by the DNA sequence of the viral genome. In view of the inability of hepatitis B virus to propagate in vitro, this strategy offers a convenient approach for further characterizing the biosynthesis of this antigen and may provide a means to identify additional polypeptides encoded by this virus.",1983

In principle, several avenues for attenuation of herpes simplex viruses (HSV) are now available. These include intermixing of HSV-1 and HSV-2 genes by recombination, altering the regulation of gene expression and the deletion of viral genes not required for replication of the virus in permissive cells in culture. Results of analyses of HSV-1 x HSV-2 recombinants and of mutants containing a deletion in a gene expressed early in infection showed a loss of virulence when infected by intracerebral route into adult Balb/c mice. In addition, immunization of the mice by intracerebral route with relatively low doses of virus protected the mice from challenge with high doses (3000 LD50) of virulent virus.

A series of mutants of simian virus 40 has been constructed with deletions in the coding sequence for large T antigen. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicates that 4 mutants have in-phase and 11 have out-of-phase deletions. Mutant DNAs were assayed for the following activities: the ability to form plaques, the ability to produce T antigen as scored by indirect immunofluorescence, viral DNA replication, and morphological transformation of rat cells. Two viable mutants were found, and these had deletions confined to the carboxyl terminus of T antigen. Only those mutants coding for polypeptides greater than 40% of the length of wildtype T antigen produced detectable nuclear fluorescence. The two viable mutants with deletions in the carboxyl terminus of the protein retained the ability both to replicate their DNA, although at a reduced level, and to transform nonpermissive cells. Mutants with sequence changes that result in the loss of more than 117 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus were not viable and were also defective in the DNA replication and transformation functions of T antigen, although several produced detectable nuclear fluorescence. These functions were also sensitive to the removal of amino acids near the amino terminus and in the middle of the protein.",1983
s106764,sv40 t antigen binding site mutations that affect autoregulation.,"sv40 t antigen binding site mutations that affect autoregulation.. Deletion and substitution mutations in the control region of simian virus 40 (SV40) were used to study regulation of early transcription by T antigen. A mutant, pIN4, containing substitutions within T antigen binding site II, is transcribed in a cell-free extract at wild-type efficiency but is unable to be repressed in vitro by purified T antigen under conditions that fully repress wild-type transcription. These results suggest a functional role for T antigen binding site II in the repression of early SV40 transcription. To investigate autoregulation in vivo, transcription from the SV40 early promoter was quantitated in COS7 monkey cells transfected with plasmid vectors carrying the mouse dihydrofolate reductase gene (SV-dhfr vectors). Mutant SV-dhfr vectors lacking T antigen site I or site II sequences overproduce dhfr RNA from the SV40 early promoter three to four fold, whereas deletion of both sites I and II or the presence of a temperature-sensitive T antigen (tsA209) results in an eight to ten fold increase in dhfr RNA. Our results indicate that binding of T antigen to both sites I and II plays a role in autoregulation.",1983
s106768,direct expression of hepatitis b surface antigen in monkey cells from an sv40 vector.,"direct expression of hepatitis b surface antigen in monkey cells from an sv40 vector.. We have developed an SV40-based vector that can be used for the efficient direct expression of foreign genes in permissive monkey cells. The vector lacks the coding sequences for the major SV40 late protein (VP-1) and possesses unique Eco RI and Bam HI restriction sites so that DNA fragments containing the coding sequences of foreign genes bounded by these two restriction sites can be conveniently inserted and directly expressed under the control of the VP-1 transcriptional unit. We have inserted into this vector the gene encoding the surface antigen of hepatitis B virus and observed the synthesis of this protein in monkey cells infected with this vector at a level comparable with that of VP-1. Furthermore, we have shown that the HBsAg synthesized is assembled into and secreted as a complex structure (22-nm particle) indistinguishable from that formed naturally during human infection. These observations enable us to conclude that HBsAg is the only component encoded by HBV that is required for the secretion and assembly of the 22-nm particle and that this process can occur without the involvement of a potential signal peptide suggested by the DNA sequence which precedes the coding region of mature HBsAg.",1982
s106919,direct expression of hepatitis b surface antigen gene in e. coli.,"direct expression of hepatitis b surface antigen gene in e. coli.. A 809 bp Sau 3A - Hpa I fragment containing a complete HBsAg gene and fragments 744 bp Hinc II - Hpa I and 712 bp Xba I - Hpa I containing a truncated HBsAg gene lacking the sequence encoding the NH2-terminal hydrophobic domain were prepared from a composite plasmid pHBV933 containing the 3.2 kb Eco RI DNA fragment of the entire HBV/adw genome and inserted into an expression vector pTRP801 to give plasmids pTRP SS-6, pTRP SS-39, and pTRP SS-50, respectively. The growth of a recombinant having pTRP SS-6 was greatly inhibited and the transformant expressed a low level of HBsAg, which is reactive to human anti-HBsAg antibody. Interestingly, the growth of transformants harbouring pTRP SS-39 and pTRP SS-50 was not inhibited and these transformants expressed a considerable level of the HBsAg. Minicells harbouring pTRP SS-6, pTRP SS-39, and pTRP SS-50 formed specific polypeptides of about 24 K, 23 K, and 22 K daltons, respectively.",1983
s106948,expression of plasmodium falciparum blood-stage antigens in escherichia coli: detection with antibodies from immune humans.,"expression of plasmodium falciparum blood-stage antigens in escherichia coli: detection with antibodies from immune humans.. Many proteins produced by blood stages of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum are natural immunogens in man. As an approach to determining which of these are relevant to protective immunity we have constructed an expression library of P. falciparum cDNA sequences, cloned in Escherichia coli. The cDNA sequences were inserted into the beta-galactosidase gene of an ampicillin-resistant derivative of the temperature-sensitive lysogenic bacteriophage lambda gt11. About 5% of the resulting clones expressed P. falciparum sequences as polypeptides fused to beta-galactosidase. We have identified many clones that express P. falciparum antigens by immunological screening in situ with antibodies from immune human sera that inhibit P. falciparum growth in vitro. The antigen-positive clones contain P. falciparum cDNA sequences, as determined by hybridization. Some express polypeptides that are larger than beta-galactosidase and react both with antibodies to beta-galactosidase and with antibodies from humans immune to P. falciparum. The cloned P. falciparum antigens should facilitate new approaches to the identification of potential vaccine molecules.",1983
s106981,association between transplantation antigens and a viral membrane protein synthesized from a mammalian expression vector.,"association between transplantation antigens and a viral membrane protein synthesized from a mammalian expression vector.. Cells infected or transformed by adenovirus-2 express complexes of the viral E19 protein and class I transplantation antigens. To eliminate the complication of the numerous metabolic changes in adenovirus-infected and -transformed cells, we detached the E19 gene from its viral background by constructing transient expression vectors where the E19 coding sequence is flanked by the SV40 early promoter and the 3' region of the rabbit beta-globulin gene. E19 production was assayed 2 days after transfection of monkey COS or human HeLa cells with vector DNA. Efficient E19 gene expression depends on the presence of an intron (the second beta-globin intron), and the E19 protein is properly processed and anchored in the plasma membrane of transfected cells. The vector-synthesized E19 protein is also associated with class I transplantation antigens in human cells, since a fraction of it is coprecipitated both with antiserum against HLA antigens and with monoclonal antibodies against beta 2-microglobulin.",1983
s106982,translational control of sv40 t antigen expressed from the adenovirus late promoter.,"translational control of sv40 t antigen expressed from the adenovirus late promoter.. We have constructed four novel adenovirus-SV40 hybrid viruses that contain the SV40 A gene at different positions downstream from the adenoviral major late promoter, within the region that encodes the second and third segments of the late tripartite RNA leader. The SV40 insert was precisely positioned in preselected regions of the adenoviral genome by using a combination of in vitro and in vivo recombination. As expected, all four recombinants produce equally high levels of SV40-encoded RNA that initiates at the adenovirus late promoter and contains two or three leader segments at the 5' end. Yet, in spite of this efficient transcription, only one virus, Ad-SVR284, directs the synthesis of high levels of SV40 large T antigen in infected cells; the other recombinants all produce approximately 20-fold less T antigen. This differential expression is, however, not seen in vitro, where equal amounts of hybrid T mRNA direct the synthesis of equal amounts of SV40 T antigen. Thus, some form of translational regulation is present in adenovirus-infected cells that is missing from the in vitro translation reaction.",1983
s107140,enhanced production of hepatitis b surface antigen in nih 3t3 mouse fibroblasts by using extrachromosomally replicating bovine papillomavirus vector.,"enhanced production of hepatitis b surface antigen in nih 3t3 mouse fibroblasts by using extrachromosomally replicating bovine papillomavirus vector.. We have constructed a recombinant pBR322 plasmid composed of a subgenomic transforming fragment of bovine papillomavirus DNA and the hepatitis B surface antigen gene from cloned hepatitis B virus DNA and used it for transfection of NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. The transformed cells retain the plasmids in extrachromosomal form with a copy number of about 50 to 100 per cell. Expression of the hepatitis B surface antigen gene linked to bovine papillomavirus DNA is independent of its orientation relative to the bovine papillomavirus vector. Cell lines continuously secreting high amounts of hepatitis B surface antigen into the medium could be established. The antigen is released into the culture medium as 22-nm particles, having the same physical properties and constituent polypeptides as those found in the serum of hepatitis B virus-infected patients.",1983
s107174,open reading frame expression vectors: a general method for antigen production in escherichia coli using protein fusions to beta-galactosidase.,"open reading frame expression vectors: a general method for antigen production in escherichia coli using protein fusions to beta-galactosidase.. We have developed an Escherichia coli plasmid vector for the identification and expression of foreign DNA segments that are open reading frames (ORFs). The 5' end of ompF, an E. coli gene encoding an abundant outer membrane protein, is used to provide a strong, regulated promoter, translation initiation site, and signal sequence for export from the cytoplasm. This sequence is coupled to the lacZ gene of E. coli so that expression of beta-galactosidase requires ompF transcription and translation signals. However, this hybrid gene is LacZ- because lacZ is out of frame with respect to ompF. Restriction enzyme recognition sites are located between ompF and lacZ to allow convenient insertion of DNA fragments. If an insert is an ORF of the correct length, ompF and lacZ become realigned in frame, resulting in a LacZ+ gene that produces a tribrid protein with the translation product of the insert sandwiched between OmpF and beta-galactosidase. The LacZ+ phenotype thus identifies clones containing an expressed ORF. To demonstrate the vector's utility we inserted a fragment from the herpes virus thymidine kinase gene and used the resulting tribrid protein to raise antibodies that precipitate thymidine kinase from herpes virus-infected cells. We also inserted a fragment from the E. coli lexA gene to produce a tribrid protein that is precipitated by antiserum raised with LexA protein. Thus, tribrid fusion proteins can be used to produce or detect antibodies and also to identify the product of a cloned gene.",1983
s107225,expression of a cloned k88ac adhesion antigen determinant: identification of a new adhesion cistron and role of a vector-encoded promoter.,"expression of a cloned k88ac adhesion antigen determinant: identification of a new adhesion cistron and role of a vector-encoded promoter.. The determinant for the K88ac adherence antigen of porcine enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli has been cloned previously onto the vector plasmid pBR322 to form the K88ac-pBR322 hybrid plasmid pMK005 (M. Kehoe et al., Nature [London] 291:122-126). Further studies on the expression of the K88ac antigen from pMK005 are presented in this paper. Expression was found to be dependent mainly on the P1 promoter of the pBR322 vector. The natural K88ac promoter was apparently not cloned from the original parental K88ac plasmid. The P1 promoter was deleted and replaced by a DNA sequence encoding the promoter-operator region of the E. coli tryptophan (Trp) operon. Cells harboring the Trp-pMK005 hybrid plasmid expressed high levels of K88ac antigen when the Trp promoter was repressed. If the promoter was derepressed either by growing the cells in low concentrations of tryptophan or in the presence of indole acrylic acid, growth of the cells harboring the Trp-pMK005 hybrid plasmid was inhibited. A quantitative assay was used to measure the levels of K88ac antigen expressed by cells harboring different pMK005::Tn5 plasmids. All cells were found to express a reduced level of K88ac antigen, providing evidence that a single transcription unit, initiating at promoter P1 of pBR322, may be involved in the expression of the K88ac antigen. By constructing specific deletion and insertion mutants of pMK005, a fifth adhesion cistron, tentatively named adhE, was identified and mapped at the proximal end of the K88ac determinant. Although the cistron is required for high-level expression of K88ac surface-associated fimbriae, as yet no gene product has been assigned to adhE.",1983
s107265,synthesis of hepatitis b surface antigen in mammalian cells: expression of the entire gene and the coding region.,"synthesis of hepatitis b surface antigen in mammalian cells: expression of the entire gene and the coding region.. We have constructed two simian virus 40 early replacement recombinants that have the coding sequences for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg). One construction, LSV-HBsAg, has the coding region for HBsAg but not the portion encoding the putative pre-surface antigen leader. Transformed monkey kidney cells (COS) infected with this recombinant express large quantities of the characteristic partially glycosylated HBsAg molecule, which are assembled into 22-nm particles that appear similar to those produced by human liver cells infected with hepatitis B virus. This result indicates that the pre-surface antigen sequences are not required for the synthesis of HBsAg or its assembly into particulate structures. The second recombinant, LSV-HBpresAg, has the entire surface antigen gene, including the putative promoter and pre-surface antigen region. COS cells infected with this recombinant plasmid produce 40- to 50-fold less HBsAg than those infected with the LSV-HBsAg recombinant plasmid. RNA mapping studies suggest that the transcription of the HBsAg gene is initiated at more than one site, or alternatively, that RNA splicing of transcripts occurs in the pre-surface antigen region.",1983
s107329,construction of live vaccines by using genetically engineered poxviruses: biological activity of recombinant vaccinia virus expressing influenza virus hemagglutinin.,"construction of live vaccines by using genetically engineered poxviruses: biological activity of recombinant vaccinia virus expressing influenza virus hemagglutinin.. Recombinant vaccinia viruses containing the cloned hemagglutinin (HA) gene from influenza virus were constructed. The biological activity of these poxvirus vectors was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Expression of HA in cells infected with recombinant vaccinia was detected by using specific anti-HA antiserum and 125I-labeled protein A, showing that HA synthesized under the regulation of vaccinia virus was antigenic. Immunization of rabbits with these recombinant poxviruses resulted in the production of antibodies reactive with authentic influenza HA as detected by radioimmunoassay, by inhibition of HA erythrocyte agglutination, and by neutralization of influenza virus infectivity. The production of antibodies directed against influenza HA suggested that the HA gene expressed in vaccinia is immunogenic. These data indicate the potential of genetically engineered poxviruses for use as generic live vaccine vehicles that have both human and veterinary applications.",1983
s107874,construction of live vaccines using genetically engineered poxviruses: biological activity of vaccinia virus recombinants expressing the hepatitis b virus surface antigen and the herpes simplex virus glycoprotein d.,"construction of live vaccines using genetically engineered poxviruses: biological activity of vaccinia virus recombinants expressing the hepatitis b virus surface antigen and the herpes simplex virus glycoprotein d.. Potential live vaccines using recombinant vaccinia viruses have been constructed for both hepatitis B and herpes simplex. These recombinant vaccinia viruses express cloned genes of the hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) or the glycoprotein D from herpes simplex virus (HSV-gD). The HBsAg synthesized in vitro under the regulation of vaccinia virus is secreted from infected cells as a particle of approximately equal to 22 nm diameter with a density of 1.2 g/ml as determined on CsCl gradients. Inoculation of rabbits with the recombinant vaccinia virus that expresses the HBsAg elicits the production of high-titered antibodies. Synthesis of the HSV-gD was detected in tissue culture by radioimmunoassay on unfixed cells, suggesting that the HSV-gD synthesized by the recombinant vaccinia virus is membrane associated. Inoculation of rabbits with the recombinant vaccinia virus expressing HSV-gD resulted in the production of antibodies that reacted with authentic HSV-gD as detected by radioimmunoassay. Furthermore, the anti-serum was shown by plaque-reduction assay to neutralize the infectivity of herpes simplex virus. Immunization of mice with the vaccinia recombinant expressing HSV-gD gave complete protection on subsequent challenge with lethal doses of live herpes simplex virus.",1984
s107959,deletions in the genomes of pseudorabies virus vaccine strains and existence of four isomers of the genomes.,"deletions in the genomes of pseudorabies virus vaccine strains and existence of four isomers of the genomes.. As part of a study designed to identify the genes responsible for the virulence of pseudorabies virus, we have mapped the genomes of two independently derived vaccine strains (Bartha and Norden) by restriction enzyme analysis. The structures of these genomes have been compared with that of the genome of a laboratory strain previously mapped, of restriction fragments which had been cloned. The genome of the Bartha strain was found to be very similar to that of other pseudorabies virus strains, except that a deletion of approximately 2.7 X 10(6) daltons was found in the unique short (US) region. This deletion was also observed in the genome of the Norden vaccine strain but was not observed in the genomes of any other pseudorabies virus strains that have been studied (more than 20). The genome of the Norden strain differs from that of other pseudorabies virus strains in several other respects as well. The most important difference is that in contrast to all other pseudorabies virus strains analyzed to date, which contain a type 2 herpesvirus DNA molecule (in which the US region only inverts itself relative to the unique long [UL] region), the genome of the Norden strain is a type 3 molecule in which both the US and the UL regions of the genome invert themselves, giving rise to four isomeric forms of the genome. The ability of the UL region to invert itself is probably related to the fact that a sequence normally present in all other pseudorabies virus strains at the end of the UL only is found also in inverted form at the junction of the UL and the internal inverted repeat in the Norden strain.",1984
s108113,recombinant nontoxinogenic vibrio cholerae strains as attenuated cholera vaccine candidates.,"recombinant nontoxinogenic vibrio cholerae strains as attenuated cholera vaccine candidates.. An ideal vaccine does not yet exist to prevent cholera, a significant health problem in many less developed countries. Vibrio cholerae, the agent of epidemic and endemic cholera, colonizes the small bowel and secretes a potent enterotoxin that consists of a single A subunit, which stimulates adenylate cyclase activity, and five identical B subunits which bind to the ganglioside GM1 receptor of intestinal mucosal cells. Previous studies in man indicate that toxoid-derived antitoxic immunity by itself is insufficient to provide effective, long-lasting protection against cholera. Using recombinant DNA techniques we have now constructed a live, attenuated V. cholerae strain by deleting genes encoding the enterotoxin. Restriction enzyme fragments encoding cholera toxin were deleted in vitro from cloned vibrio chromosomal DNA and the resulting mutations introduced into the chromosome of a vibrio strain of proven immunogenicity. Recently, Mekalanos and coworkers have reported attenuated V. cholerae strains constructed by similar methods. It appears that recombinant DNA techniques offer a promising approach to the development of effective cholera vaccines.",1984
s108289,transgenic mice harboring sv40 t-antigen genes develop characteristic brain tumors.,"transgenic mice harboring sv40 t-antigen genes develop characteristic brain tumors.. A high percentage of transgenic mice developing from eggs microinjected with plasmids containing the SV40 early region genes and a metallothionein fusion gene develop tumors within the choroid plexus. A line of mice has been established in which nearly every affected animal succumbs to this brain tumor. Thymic hypertrophy and kidney pathology are also observed in some mice. SV40 T-antigen mRNA and protein are readily detected in affected tissues; however, SV40 T-antigen gene expression is barely detectable in unaffected tissues or in susceptible tissues prior to overt pathology, suggesting that tumorigenesis depends upon activation of the SV40 genes. Comparison of DNA from tumor tissue (or cell lines derived from tumors) with DNA from unaffected tissues reveals structural rearrangements as well as changes in DNA methylation of the foreign DNA. The SV40 genes are frequently amplified in tumor tissue, which further indicates that their expression is intimately involved in tumorigenesis in transgenic mice.",1984
s108538,bacterial synthesis of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 glycoprotein d antigens.,"bacterial synthesis of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 glycoprotein d antigens.. We have used elements of the E. coli lactose (lac) operon to produce a collection of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 glycoprotein D (gD-1 and gD-2) antigens. Our approach employed recombinant DNA techniques to construct plasmids with various segments of the gD-1 and gD-2 coding sequences fused to the lacZ gene. Such hybrid genes were expressed in a regulated manner in E. coli by joining them to the lac promoter-operator region. Efficient translation of these hybrid genes was facilitated by incorporating a coding sequence specifying a short peptide leader (lambda cro) in the plasmid expression vectors resulting in synthesis of chimeric Cro-gD-beta-galactosidase proteins. In addition, insertion of synthetic translation terminators at the junction of gD and lacZ enabled us to produce specific truncated gD polypeptide sequences unfused to beta-galactosidase. The gD antigens produced in E. coli were not glycosylated and were generally recovered as dense insoluble aggregates. Proteins containing portions of gD-1 or gD-2 were analyzed by immunoprecipitation using anti-HSV rabbit serum and a number of monoclonal antibodies recognizing different epitopes of gD-1. Initial animal studies were done with antigens that reacted with neutralizing antisera or monoclonal antibodies. When these bacterially produced proteins were injected into rabbits, antibodies were produced that specifically immunoprecipitated authentic gD polypeptides and neutralized the infectivity of both virus types. These studies suggest that gene fusion techniques can be used to produce immunogenic proteins in large quantity. These polypeptides are not only useful in analyses of gene structure and function, but also can provide novel diagnostic reagents and well-defined pure antigens for vaccine development.",1984
s108757,expression of hepatitis b surface antigen gene in yeast.,expression of hepatitis b surface antigen gene in yeast.. The DNA sequence coding for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) was placed under control of the repressible acid phosphatase promoter of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a plasmid capable of autonomous replication in both yeast and Escherichia coli. Yeast transformed by this plasmid synthesized up to 5 X 10(5) molecules per cell of immunologically active HBsAg polypeptide in phosphate-free medium. The HBsAg polypeptides produced in the yeast cells were assembled into 20- to 22-nm spherical or oval particles and were immunogenic.,1983
s108837,cloning and expression in e. coli of the malarial sporozoite surface antigen gene from plasmodium knowlesi.,"cloning and expression in e. coli of the malarial sporozoite surface antigen gene from plasmodium knowlesi.. The malarial sporozoite, the infective stage found in the salivary gland of the insect vector, bears highly immunogenic surface antigen(s). Repeated exposure to irradiated sporozoites induces protection against malaria in several host species, including man. Further, monoclonal antibodies that confer passive immunity react with the immunogenic surface determinants of different sporozoite species. One approach to prevent malaria, therefore, would be to produce a vaccine that induces high titres of circulating antibodies against the sporozoite surface determinant(s). However, production of such a vaccine has not been possible since sporozoites cannot be cultivated in vitro and, therefore, only limited amounts of surface antigen may be obtained. To overcome this problem, we have prepared mRNA from Plasmodium knowlesi-infected mosquitoes to construct a cDNA library. From this library we have isolated a clone that expresses the sporozoite surface antigen as a beta-lactamase fusion protein in the plasmid pBR322. This is the first potentially protective malarial antigen to be cloned by recombinant DNA technology.",1983
s108960,expression of hepatitis b virus surface antigen in yeast.,"expression of hepatitis b virus surface antigen in yeast.. The structural gene of Hepatitis B virus surface protein (HBsAg) was introduced into a plasmid capable of autonomous replication and selection in both the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and E. coli. In this plasmid transcription of the HBsAg is initiated by the 5'-flanking sequence of the yeast 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) gene and terminated by the 3'-flanking region of the yeast TRP1 gene. Yeast cells containing this plasmid produce a new major species of mRNA of 1200 nucleotides in length coding for HBsAg. Viral surface antigen is made in nonglycosylated form at a level of about 1-2 percent of total yeast protein. A small fraction of this polypeptide (2-5 percent) is found in aggregated form upon yeast cell disruption by glass beads. This material is similar in size, density, and shape to the 22nm particle, isolated from the plasma of human hepatitis carriers, and induced comparable levels of HBsAg antibodies in mice when compared with the natural particle.",1983
s108969,fluorescence-activated cell sorting of mouse-human hybrid cells aids in locating the gene for the leu 7 (hnk-1) antigen to human chromosome 11.,"fluorescence-activated cell sorting of mouse-human hybrid cells aids in locating the gene for the leu 7 (hnk-1) antigen to human chromosome 11.. Leu 7 (HNK-1) is a membrane antigen expressed on human natural killer cells and some other lymphoid cells. Starting with two clones of mouse-human hybrid lymphoid cells that had 1.6% and 35% Leu 7-positive cells, respectively, we viably sorted Leu 7-positive and -negative cells using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). Short-term progeny of the sorted cells were then karyotyped. Chromosome 11 was the only human chromosome that was absent from the Leu 7-negative population and present in nearly all of the progeny of the Leu 7-positive selected cells. Thus, we assigned the Leu 7 gene to chromosome 11.",1983
s109028,cloned genomic dna sequences from mycoplasma hyorhinis encoding antigens expressed in escherichia coli.,"cloned genomic dna sequences from mycoplasma hyorhinis encoding antigens expressed in escherichia coli.. A library of cloned Mycoplasma hyorhinis genomic sequences was constructed by incorporation of EcoRI digestion fragments of mycoplasma DNA into the lambda Charon 4A bacteriophage vector. Immunological screening of recombinant phage plaques identified clones containing genes encoding mycoplasma antigenic structures expressed in an Escherichia coli host. Two such recombinant phage isolates, lambda Ch4A-MhrG1 and lambda Ch4A-MhrG28, were defined and found to contain distinct genomic sequences by analysis of restriction endonuclease fragments. Inoculation of mice with recombinant gene products from lambda Ch4A-MhrG1 yielded antiserum selectively recognizing a Mr 29,500 trypsin-sensitive mycoplasma constituent. This established a means for producing selected immunogenic mycoplasma component in a bacterial host. The cloned genomic sequences of M. hyorhinis encoding expressed mycoplasma antigens represent molecular probes that can be characterized both by specific DNA sequences and by the antigenic structure of corresponding gene products. These genomic fragments define initial physical markers of the M. hyorhinis genome and may be useful in assessing antigenic and molecular genetic relationships within the genus Mycoplasma and among other members of the class Mollicutes.",1983
s109115,antigens of the erythrocytes stages of the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum detected by monoclonal antibodies.,"antigens of the erythrocytes stages of the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum detected by monoclonal antibodies.. A range of 22 mouse anti-P. falciparum monoclonal antibodies have been characterized by indirect immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation. On the basis of these studies, 5 groups of antibodies and 6 classes of antigen were defined. Group I antibodies give, bright, uniform, generalised staining of all blood stages including gametocytes. Three of these antibodies precipitate a metabolically labelled molecule(s) of 35 kDa. One precipitates a 50 kDa antigen. Group II antibodies, which give strong localised immunofluorescence in merozoites, and a weak diffuse pattern in earlier stages, precipitate biosynthetically labelled molecules of 160 kDa. Group III antibodies react with all asexual stages. With merozoites they produce intense staining around the perimeter, both in fixed and unfixed preparations. They precipitate biosynthetic molecules of 190 kDa. Group IV antibodies are identical to Group III except they are stage restricted to schizonts and merozoites. They also precipitate 190 kDa antigens. These, however, in contrast to group III, are readily accessible to 125I-lactoperoxidase labelling. One antibody also precipitates a set of smaller peptides. Finally, Group V antibodies produce very bright ill-defined staining of pigment-containing parasites, as well as of inclusions in the red cell. They precipitate a series of molecules of 160, 60 and 35 kDa which are readily accessible to 125I. The 160 kDa molecule is also labelled by [35S]methionine. These results are discussed in the context of the development of a malaria vaccine and immunodiagnostic tests.",1983

Antibodies raised against a Plasmodium falciparum protein expressed in Escherichia coli reacted with a 220,000-molecular weight antigen of mature blood-stage parasites. The protein resembles the sporozoite surface antigen being composed of tandem repeats of 11 amino acids. However, it is isolate-specific and the encoding gene is not detectable in strains that do not express the protein.",1983
s109581,identification of a cdna clone encoding a mature blood stage antigen of plasmodium falciparum by immunization of mice with bacterial lysates.,"identification of a cdna clone encoding a mature blood stage antigen of plasmodium falciparum by immunization of mice with bacterial lysates.. A cDNA library was constructed in pBR322 using mRNA from blood stages of a Papua New Guinean isolate of Plasmodium falciparum. Expression of parasite antigens was not directly detectable by conventional immunological assays. To circumvent this, mice were immunized with lysates of cDNA clones, and the antisera raised were assayed for anti-parasite reactivity. One cDNA clone was identified which reliably elicited antibodies to P. falciparum. The mouse antisera were used to characterize the native P. falciparum protein as a 120-kd protein, which is antigenic during natural infection. The protein occurs in late trophozoite and schizont stages and is found in isolates of the parasite from widely separated geographical areas. The genomic context of the antigen gene is conserved in the different isolates.",1984

s109794,unusual lipopolysaccharide antigens of a salmonella typhi oral vaccine strain expressing the shigella sonnei form i antigen.,"unusual lipopolysaccharide antigens of a salmonella typhi oral vaccine strain expressing the shigella sonnei form i antigen.. Salmonella typhi 5076-1C, a potential live, oral vaccine for protection against typhoid fever and Shigella sonnei shigellosis, expresses the S. sonnei form I antigen and normal S. typhi somatic antigens. Polysaccharide antigens of this galactose epimeraseless genetic derivative strain were hot phenol-water extracted from cells grown with (+gal) and without (-gal) galactose. Ultracentrifugation of the aqueous layer from (+gal) cells resulted in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pellet having core-linked S. typhi O-antigen but no core-linked form I antigen; the LPS from (-gal) cells lacked O-antigen. The form I antigen, obtained from the supernatant, was purified by alcohol precipitation and ion exchange chromatography. Unlinked form I and S. typhi O-polysaccharide antigens, both present in the (+gal) supernatant, were further separated by gel filtration. Chemical analyses revealed the 5076-1C form I antigen to be a polymer (Mr = 14,000-20,000) having O-disaccharide repeating units comprised of 2-acetamido-4-amino-2, 4,6-trideoxy-D-galactose and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-L-altruronic acid. Unlike parental S. sonnei form I LPS, the 5076-1C form I antigen lacked core lipid A, had low phosphorus content, and migrated in polyacrylamide gels with lower relative mobility. In contrast to current concepts of LPS assembly, these data indicate that 5076-1C form I antigen is transported to the cell surface without covalent linkage to core lipid A, and exists as a polymerized, antigenic surface entity.",1984
s110008,oral vaccination of monkeys with an invasive escherichia coli k-12 hybrid expressing shigella flexneri 2a somatic antigen.,"oral vaccination of monkeys with an invasive escherichia coli k-12 hybrid expressing shigella flexneri 2a somatic antigen.. A living oral vaccine, designed to protect against Shigella flexneri 2a infections, was constructed by using Escherichia coli K-12 as a carrier strain. The hybrid strain, designated EC104, contained both chromosomal and plasmid genes from S. flexneri donor strains. In addition to expressing the S. flexneri 2a somatic antigen, it had inherited the property of epithelial-cell invasion. After the oral administration to rhesus monkeys, EC104 was isolated from the feces for up to 3 days, but by day 4 all stool cultures were negative. The serum antibody response against S. flexneri 2a somatic antigen was variable, but the vaccine conferred significant protection against an oral challenge with virulent S. flexneri 2a.",1984
s110009,expression of lipopolysaccharide o antigen in escherichia coli k-12 hybrids containing plasmid and chromosomal genes from shigella dysenteriae 1.,"expression of lipopolysaccharide o antigen in escherichia coli k-12 hybrids containing plasmid and chromosomal genes from shigella dysenteriae 1.. The requirement for both plasmid and chromosomal genes in the biosynthesis of Shigella dysenteriae 1 lipopolysaccharide O antigen was demonstrated in Escherichia coli-Shigella hybrids. A 6-megadalton S. dysenteriae 1 plasmid, designated pWR23, was phenotypically tagged with the Tn3 ampicillin-resistance transposon. The tagged plasmid, designated pWR24, was transferred by transformation or conjugal mobilization to a rough E. coli K-12 recipient. Although the resultant hybrids were agglutinated in S. dysenteriae 1 antiserum, they did not remove all of the anti-Shiga agglutinins in absorption experiments. Modified lipid A core structure was detected in these hybrids, but Shiga O antigen was not expressed. When the his+ locus of the S. dysenteriae 1 chromosome was transferred by transduction to E. coli K-12 containing pWR24, complete Shiga O antigen was expressed. Lipopolysaccharide extracted from these hybrids was indistinguishable chemically, electrophoretically, and serologically from native S. dysenteriae 1 lipopolysaccharide.",1984
s110010,construction of a potential live oral bivalent vaccine for typhoid fever and cholera-escherichia coli-related diarrheas.,"construction of a potential live oral bivalent vaccine for typhoid fever and cholera-escherichia coli-related diarrheas.. We used the Salmonella typhi galactose epimerase (galE) mutant strain Ty21a, shown to be a safe, effective, living, attenuated oral typhoid vaccine, as a recipient for a recombinant plasmid containing the gene for production of the nontoxic B subunit of the heat-labile enterotoxin of Escherichia coli. The S. typhi derivative, strain SE12, produced heat-labile enterotoxin subunit B that was structurally and immunologically indistinguishable from heat-labile enterotoxin subunit B produced by strains of E. coli harboring the same plasmid. Tests in mice and guinea pigs showed that strain SE12 was safe when given orally and was capable of inducing a significant antitoxic antibody response when injected parenterally. Moreover, it retained the galactose sensitivity of the parent strain, preserving its utility as a typhoid vaccine. This strain may prove to be a useful live oral bivalent vaccine strain for typhoid fever and cholera-E. coli-related diarrheas.",1984
s110051,"recognition of hla-a2 and -b7 antigens by cloned cytotoxic t lymphocytes after gene transfer into human and monkey, but not mouse, cells.","recognition of hla-a2 and -b7 antigens by cloned cytotoxic t lymphocytes after gene transfer into human and monkey, but not mouse, cells.. The genes that code for the human major histocompatibility class I antigens, HLA-A2 and HLA-B7, were introduced into human, monkey, and mouse cell lines by cotransfection with suitable biochemical markers and the fluorescence-activated cell sorter was used to identify and/or select stable cell populations expressing high surface levels of these antigens. Levels of expression obtained were similar to those observed for endogenous HLA antigens on various human cell lines and were 25-80% of those observed on the human B-lymphoblastoid cell line JY. Serologically defined HLA-A2 and HLA-B7 polymorphic determinants remained intact on all transfected recipient cells analyzed. Cloned human allospecific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) specific for HLA-A2 or HLA-B7 were capable of lysing appropriate HLA-transfected human cells with comparable efficiency to JY cell lysis. Two of 10 CTL clones lysed appropriate monkey cell transfectants with approximately equal to 20% the efficiency of human cell transfectants. No specific lysis of any HLA-transfected mouse cell lines, including a B cell lymphoma, was observed despite comparable levels of surface antigen expression or after induction of higher levels by mouse gamma-interferon. Furthermore, L cells expressing human beta 2-microglobulin in addition to HLA-A2 or -B7 were not lysed by these CTL. Thus, an additional species-specific component may be involved in lysis by allogeneic CTL--possibly related to the function(s) of other surface proteins on target cells.",1984
s110359,"interferon-gamma induces enhanced expression of ia and h-2 antigens on b lymphoid, macrophage, and myeloid cell lines.","interferon-gamma induces enhanced expression of ia and h-2 antigens on b lymphoid, macrophage, and myeloid cell lines.. The levels of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens (la antigens) on cells of a cultured B lymphoma line (WEHI-279) were significantly increased after 24 hr incubation with medium conditioned by concanavalin A-stimulated mouse or rat spleen cells, or by an azobenzenearsonate- (ABA) specific T cell clone that had been stimulated with ABA-coupled spleen cells or concanavalin A. The levels and properties of the la-inducing activity correlated with those of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) measured by inhibition of virus plaque formation. Both the la-inducing activity and the IFN-gamma from the T cell clone had an apparent m.w. of 40,000 determined by gel filtration, were sensitive to treatment with trypsin or exposure to pH 2, but were stable to heat (56 degrees C, 1 hr). The induction of la antigens on WEHI-279 cells was dose-dependent, and the maximum response occurred at a concentration corresponding to 1 to 2 U/ml of antiviral activity. This T cell-derived IFN-gamma-like molecule also increased the expression of cell surface la antigens on another B cell line (WEHI-231), and cell lines of macrophage (J774) and myeloid (WEHI-3B and WEHI-265) origin. Furthermore, in all cases the levels of class I MHC (H-2K or H-2D) antigens were also increased. Similar patterns of induction of Ia and H-2 antigens were obtained with supernatants containing IFN-gamma produced by a monkey cell line (COS) that had been transfected with a plasmid bearing the cloned murine IFN-gamma gene. This activity was sensitive to pH 2 and was not present in the supernatant from COS cells that were not transfected with the murine IFN-gamma gene. These results established that IFN-gamma is the T cell-derived molecule that induces the enhanced expression of Ia and H-2 antigens on B cells and macrophages. A major physiologic role of IFN-gamma may be to regulate immune function through the enhanced expression of MHC antigens.",1983
s110438,cloning of the protective antigen gene of bacillus anthracis.,"cloning of the protective antigen gene of bacillus anthracis.. The tripartite protein toxin of Bacillus anthracis consists of protective antigen (PA), edema factor (EF), and lethal factor (LF). As a first step in developing a more efficacious anthrax vaccine, recombinant plasmids containing the PA gene have been isolated. A library was constructed in the E. coli vector pBR322 from Bam HI-generated fragments of the anthrax plasmid, pBA1. Two clones producing PA were identified by screening lysates with ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Western blots revealed a full-size PA protein in the recombinant E. coli, and a cell elongation assay demonstrated biological activity. Both positive clones had a 6 kb insert of DNA, which mapped in the Bam HI site of the vector. The two inserts are the same except that they lie in opposite orientations with respect to the vector. Thus PA is encoded by the plasmid pBA1.",1983
s110899,chimeric human antibody molecules: mouse antigen-binding domains with human constant region domains.,"chimeric human antibody molecules: mouse antigen-binding domains with human constant region domains.. We have created mouse-human antibody molecules of defined antigen-binding specificity by taking the variable region genes of a mouse antibody-producing myeloma cell line with known antigen-binding specificity and joining them to human immunoglobulin constant region genes using recombinant DNA techniques. Chimeric genes were constructed that utilized the rearranged and expressed antigen-binding variable region exons from the myeloma cell line S107, which produces an IgA (kappa) anti-phosphocholine antibody. The heavy chain variable region exon was joined to human IgG1 or IgG2 heavy chain constant region genes, and the light chain variable region exon from the same myeloma was joined to the human kappa light chain gene. These genes were transfected into mouse myeloma cell lines, generating transformed cells that produce chimeric mouse-human IgG (kappa) or IgG (kappa) anti-phosphocholine antibodies. The transformed cell lines remained tumorigenic in mice and the chimeric molecules were present in the ascitic fluids and sera of tumor-bearing mice.",1984
s111003,monoclonal antibodies to hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag) with anti-alpha specificity recognize a synthetic peptide analogue (s135-155) with unmodified lysine (141).,"monoclonal antibodies to hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag) with anti-alpha specificity recognize a synthetic peptide analogue (s135-155) with unmodified lysine (141).. A synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 135-155 (S135-155) of the major protein component of HBsAg was conjugated to beta-galactosidase. This conjugate reacted with monoclonal anti-HBs antibodies having anti-alpha group specificity. The reaction was inhibited by: HBsAg of either subtype ad or ay; by unconjugated S135-155 or a shorter peptide S140-155, but not by unrelated peptides. Modification of lysine residues of either HBsAg or S135-155 reduced this inhibitory effect. These results indicate that Lys 141 is essential for maintaining the antigenicity of one of the epitopes responsible for the common alpha specificity of HBsAg and that studies involving the use of synthetic peptides and modifications of distinct amino acid residues in the native protein or in the peptide may help in characterizing epitopes of viral antigens in general.",1984

During 1981, the A/Brazil/11/78-like strains of influenza virus that had been prevalent from 1978 to 1980 were displaced by a new set of heterogeneous, but closely related, variants (reference strain, A/England/333/80). Genomic analysis revealed that these new variants were almost exclusively nonrecombinant H1N1 viruses, i.e., they contained no genes of H3N2 origin. However, a few recombinant viruses containing the new variant HA and genes of H3N2 origin were identified. Antigenic analysis of H3N2 viruses indicated that they were also heterogeneous. The majority of these virus isolates were antigenically intermediate between A/Texas/1/77 and A/Bangkok/1/79, but additional variants were detected. Genomic analysis revealed that the H3N2 viruses isolated in the winter of 1980-81 were quite similar to H3N2 viruses isolated from 1977-79 in their T(1) oligonucleotide maps. No H1N1 genes were detected in H3N2 virus isolates. Comparison of pairs of oligonucleotide maps of total virus RNA indicated that a similar rate of genetic change had occurred for nonrecombinant H1N1 viruses, for recombinant H1N1 viruses, and for H3N2 viruses and that, in general, pairs of viruses exhibited increasing numbers of changes in their oligonucleotide maps as the time interval between isolation of the viruses increased.",1983
s112496,purified lupus antigen la recognizes an oligouridylate stretch common to the 3' termini of rna polymerase iii transcripts.,"purified lupus antigen la recognizes an oligouridylate stretch common to the 3' termini of rna polymerase iii transcripts.. The small ribonucleoproteins recognized by anti-La sera consist mainly of RNA polymerase III products complexed with an antigenic cellular protein of 50 kd. A biochemical procedure for purifying the La protein from HeLa cells is described. The interaction of the isolated protein with a collection of model tRNA precursors, generated by ligation of specific oligonucleotides to the 3' terminus of yeast tRNAPhe, was studied. The most stable complexes are formed with adducts possessing three or four terminal uridylate residues. Addition of a terminal phosphate, fragmentation of the RNA, or substitution of other nucleotides reduce the affinity for the La protein. The preferred terminal sequence recognized and bound by La protein is homologous to the transcriptional termination signal for RNA polymerase III.",1984
s112674,subcutaneous administration of inactivated hepatitis b vaccine by automatic jet injection.,"subcutaneous administration of inactivated hepatitis b vaccine by automatic jet injection.. To assess the feasibility of jet injection for mass immunization against hepatitis B virus, inactivated, alum-adsorbed hepatitis B vaccine (Merck, Sharp, and Dohme Research Laboratories, West Point, PA) was administered subcutaneously by automatic jet injection to 19 volunteers lacking antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs). Three 20-microgram doses were given at 0, 1, and 6 months. Of 19 volunteers, 5 (26%) developed anti-HBs by 1 month after the first injection, and 15 of 19 (79%) were anti-HBs-positive 6 to 8 weeks after the first booster administration. Following the second booster, 16 of 19 (84%) recipients had detectable anti-HBs. Possible systemic reactions were limited to low-grade fever (37.8 degrees C) in one volunteer following one injection, and mild lethargy in a second recipient. Local reactions to jet injection of vaccine occurred more frequently, with indurated, nodular lesions 3-10 mm in diameter developing at the site of 19 of 57 (33%) vaccine injections, compared with 2 of 57 (3%) saline placebo injections. Such nodules were generally painless. Sore arms were noted in 11 of 57 (19%) vaccine injections. With the exception of frequent but minor local reactions, subcutaneous administration of inactivated hepatitis B vaccine by automatic jet injection is safe, and results in vaccine immunogenicity approximating that associated with intramuscular needle injection.",1983
s112693,signals regulating hepatitis b surface antigen transcription.,"signals regulating hepatitis b surface antigen transcription.. About 200 million people are chronic carriers of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), but since hepatitis B virus (HBV) cannot be propagated in vitro, HBsAg transcription has been studied only in cell lines containing HBV DNA integrated into chromosomes, and HBsAg-related mRNAs 2.0 to 2.5 kilobases (kb) long have been described. We have analysed the transcripts produced in an infected chimpanzee liver and in a rat cell line containing HBV DNA. In contrast to previous suppositions we report here that the major S gene transcript initiates close to the S gene, that is, within the 'pre-S' region and is processed/polyadenylated at a site situated within the core gene. The efficiency of processing/polyadenylation at this site varies between the chimpanzee liver and the rat cell line studied. The S gene promoter does not contain a TATA box but instead has a sequence homologous to that which positions the 5' ends of the major simian virus 40 (SV40) late transcript.",1983
s112771,antigenicity and evolution amongst recent influenza viruses of h1n1 subtype.,"antigenicity and evolution amongst recent influenza viruses of h1n1 subtype.. The sequence of the HA1 subunit region of the haemagglutinin gene of influenza A/USSR/90/77, and A/Brazil/11/78, A/Lackland/3/78, A/England/333/80 and A/India/6263/80 was determined by dideoxy-sequencing methods using total virion RNA and specific oligonucleotide primers for reverse transcriptase. These 1977-1980 strains share a minimum of 85% amino acid sequence homology with influenza A/PR/8/34. Most of the surface amino acid substitutions which occurred during the evolution of A/PR/8/34 to A/USSR/90/77 and subsequently in the 1978-1980 strains are located in the 4 antigenic sites previously defined by an analysis of laboratory-selected mutants of A/PR/8/34. We deduce an evolutionary pathway for the 1977-80 strains and suggest their different epidemic properties may be a consequence of only a few amino acid changes.",1983

The relationships of various polypeptides associated with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), ground squirrel hepatitis surface antigen (GSHsAg), woodchuck hepatitis surface antigen (WHsAg), and duck hepatitis B surface antigen (DHBsAg) were studied by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and tryptic peptide mapping. Analysis of independent antigen isolates by SDS-PAGE resulted in bands consistently observed at 24,000, 28,000, 32,000, 43,000, and 50,000 Da with HBsAg; at 22,000, 25,000, 35,000, 37,000, 39,000, and 42,000 Da with GSHsAg and WHsAg; and at 18,500, 30,000, and 38,500, Da with DHBsAg. Comparison of the major polypeptide pair from the mammalian viruses by tryptic peptide mapping suggests more than a single point of glycosylation or other post-translational modification(s) in some paired comparisons and/or heterogeneity in glycosylation in others. Comparison of the major component of each mammalian virus (HBsAg p24, GSHsAg p22, or WHsAg p22), or the major polypeptide of DHBsAg (p18.5), with their respective larger polypeptides by peptide mapping indicated that one or more of the larger components in each virus shares extensive homology with the appropriate major component. Further, these larger components possess additional spots, interpreted as additional primary sequences, which were not found in the map of the appropriate major component. Collectively, the results suggest that a number of surface antigen-associated polypeptides may be partially encoded for by the pre-S gene region known to exist in hepatitis B virus (HBV) and woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), and likely to exist in ground squirrel hepatitis virus (GSHV) and duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) DNA.",1983

s112887,expression of hepatitis b surface antigen in yeast.,"expression of hepatitis b surface antigen in yeast.. The genomes of HBV viruses of two different serotypes were cloned in E. coli. Sequences coding for the major polypeptides of surface antigen (HBsAg) were fused with the 5' end of a cloned yeast arg3 gene. When introduced into yeast, on a suitable vector, the hybrid gene directed the synthesis of a fusion protein. Crude extracts of such strains were shown to contain HBsAg like material having physical properties characteristic of the antigen isolated from the plasma of chronic human carriers, as judged by isopycnic and rate zonal centrifugation. Furthermore, these extracts readily elicit specific anti-HBsAg antibodies in rabbits. Further manipulations of the 5' part of the arg3 gene resulted in the introduction of a unique restriction site located in the 5' non translated leader sequence. The resulting vector was used to construct a recombinant plasmid directing the synthesis of the mature (226 amino acids) HBsAg polypeptide.",1983
s112888,characterization of pre-s gene products in hepatitis b surface antigen.,"characterization of pre-s gene products in hepatitis b surface antigen.. The 20-nm particles of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) contain two minor glycoproteins, GP33 and GP36, which are probably encoded at their 55 N-terminal amino acids by the pre-s region of the viral DNA. Their 226 C-terminal amino acids are identical to the major protein P24. The 20-nm particles contained more GP33 and GP36 when the blood had a high HBsAg concentration. They were also found in relatively high amounts in HBsAg filaments and virions. Treatment with glycosidase and trypsin showed that the mannose rich glycan and the N-terminal portion of GP33 and GP36 were exposed at the surface of the HBsAg particles. The 20-nm particles containing much GP33 and GP36 did not induce higher anti-HBs titers in guinea pigs than those particles almost devoid of them.",1983

The Toxoplasma gondii antigenic components eliciting the immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, and IgA antibody responses were studied by using follow-up sera from a laboratory worker who developed an acute glandular toxoplasmosis after an accidental infection with the protozoa. IgG toxoplasma antibodies reacted with multiple components over a wide molecular weight range from 6,000 to 150,000. In contrast, IgM toxoplasma antibodies reacted predominantly with polypeptides of 6, 25, and 35 kilodaltons, which might be useful in new diagnostic procedures. The general pattern of antigenic components in the IgA toxoplasma antibody response closely resembled that in the IgM response, even though some characteristic features were constantly observed. The possibility that the restricted IgM and IgA antibody responses relate to the pathogenetic events in human toxoplasmosis is considered.",1984
s113730,the antigenicity of myoglobin-related peptides synthesised on polyacrylamide and polystyrene resin supports.,"the antigenicity of myoglobin-related peptides synthesised on polyacrylamide and polystyrene resin supports.. Polyacrylamide resins [Atherton et al., Bioorg. Chem. 8, 351-370 (1979)] have been found suitable for solid-phase radioimmunoassay of peptides synthesised on the same supports; they are sufficiently stable during side-chain deprotection and swell sufficiently in aq. media to admit antibody molecules to the sites of peptide attachment. A re-examination of five synthetic peptide sequences corresponding to (15-21), (56-62), (94-99), (113-119) and (145-151) of beef myoglobin analogous to those delineated by Atassi [Immunochemistry 12, 423-438 (1975)] for sperm whale myoglobin shows that they all bind anti-beef myoglobin antibodies raised in rabbits, with binding capacities in the order V = III greater than IV greater than I = II. The resin-bound peptide (72-88) binds such antibodies even more extensively, as do certain sequential variants of peptide V. Other peptides, bound to polyacrylamide or polystyrene resins but unrelated to any of the five sequences and varying in size and amino acid composition and sequence were also tested with various antisera. It was concluded that the antibody binding properties of the 30 or so small peptides (two-seven residues) are dominated by their cationic and/or hydrophobic properties. In small peptides, therefore, antibody binding can be safely interpreted only in terms of general structural properties but not in terms of biological specificity. The latter property becomes assessable only with peptides representing larger areas of antigenic protein surfaces.",1984
s113970,"an immune response against the alloantigens of the 3ll lewis lung carcinoma prevents the growth of lung metastases, but not of local allografts.","an immune response against the alloantigens of the 3ll lewis lung carcinoma prevents the growth of lung metastases, but not of local allografts.. 3LL tumor cells inoculated intra footpad grow locally both in syngeneic and in allogeneic recipients. Yet, spontaneous lung metastases appear only in syngeneic animals or in mice which share with the tumor strain of origin both the D-end of the H-2b haplotype and the genetic background. The lack of lung metastases in allogeneic recipients is not due to tissue restrictions for tumor growth, since intravenous injections of tumor cells resulted in local primary lung tumors. The growth rate of primary intra footpad tumors or pulmonary tumors in syngeneic mice is similar to that in congenic resistant recombinant mice. From a local intra footpad tumor in BALB/c mice, 3LL cells migrate out and reach the lungs but are arrested there, since grafts of lungs from such mice onto (BALB/c X C57BL/6)F1 resulted in tumor growth. Since spontaneous metastases developed in chimeric (C3HeB X C57BL/6)F1----C3HeB mice, it appeared that immunogenetic restrictions prevent the growth of spontaneous 3LL metastases in allogeneic recipients. Further support for the notion of allograft rejection of lung metastases derived from experiments demonstrating the generation of metastases in nu/nu ICR mice but not in nu/+ heterozygous ICR animals. It thus appeared that the local allograft of the 3LL tumor elicits a reaction which prevents the growth of its metastases. This was further supported in experiments in which intravenous inoculation of 3LL cells to allogeneic recipients from which the local tumor was removed did not produce lung tumors.",1982

These results are in good agreement with those from other laboratories. In addition, antigens from a new group of hybridomas, generated since the first Workshop, were studied. Some of these antigens are unique and others are duplicates of the original set. Finally, a melanoma-associated antigen (260 kd) was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography.",1982
s114550,somatic mutation in a cultured mouse myeloma cell affects antigen binding.,"somatic mutation in a cultured mouse myeloma cell affects antigen binding.. The S107 mouse myeloma cell line synthesizes an IgA antibody that binds the hapten phosphocholine and is similar if not identical in its heavy and light chain variable region sequence to the predominant antibody produced by BALB/c mice in response to immunization with phosphocholine. This cell line frequently and spontaneously generates somatic variants producing immunoglobulins with decreased ability to bind antigen. One such variant, S 107.U1, is described here. This variant has a decreased ability to bind phosphocholine when it is attached to a carrier, although its affinity for free hapten is the same as that of the parent. This decrease in antigen binding is associated with a single amino acid substitution at the fifth residue in the JH segment.",1982

One of the hybridomas secreted a monoclonal IgG1 antibody, 48.7, which binds to a cell surface antigen of cells from human melanomas and compound nevi. The presence of the target antigen in vivo was demonstrated immunohistologically by staining frozen sections of primary and metastatic melanoma by the peroxidase anti-peroxidase technique. Weak staining of some blood vessel cells was also seen, but other normal cells, including skin melanocytes, were unstained, as were cells from other tumor types.

Porcine parvovirus (PPV) was extensively purified from infected swine fetal homogenates by CaCl2 precipitation followed by CsCl density centrifugation. Two species of particles possessing PPV-specific hemagglutinating activity were observed banding at densities of 1.39 and 1.30 g/ml, representing full and empty 20-nm virion particles, respectively. Both classes of particles contained three major polypeptides. A, B, and C, with respective molecular weights of 83,000, 64,000, and 60,000. The amount of polypeptide A was similar in both species (approximately 10%); however, the B protein was most abundant in the 1.30-g/ml particles, whereas the C protein was the major polypeptide found in the 1.39-g/ml particles. Antisera generated to each sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel-purified virion structural protein had reactivities qualitatively similar to those of conventional antisera raised against intact PPV in a variety of standard serological assays. The antisera generated against the individual sodium dodecyl sulfate-denatured PPV polypeptides were able to react with native, intact PPV virions and were capable of neutralizing virus infectivity.",1983
s115190,core and e antigen synthesis in rodent cells transformed with hepatitis b virus dna is associated with greater than genome length viral messenger rnas.,"core and e antigen synthesis in rodent cells transformed with hepatitis b virus dna is associated with greater than genome length viral messenger rnas.. The viral RNA sequences in a number of rodent cell lines which contain integrated hepatitis B virus DNA were examined. In one of the cell lines, which produces the hepatitis B virus surface, core and e antigens, there are four polyadenylated, cytoplasmic RNA species, estimated to be 4425, 3968, 2435 and 1054 nucleotides in length, which hybridize with hepatitis B virus DNA. All four were shown to be transcripts of the coding strand of the virus genome and the regions contained in each RNA molecule were determined by hybridization with probes from different parts of the genome. The two largest RNAs hybridized with probes from all parts of the genome. The 2.4 x 10(3) nucleotide RNA, which is the same size as the previously identified surface antigen messenger RNA, hybridized with probes covering the surface antigen gene but not with probes corresponding to the core antigen gene. It also hybridized with a probe mapping upstream of a sequence previously suggested to be its promoter. The 10(3) nucleotide RNA was mapped to the X gene region and thus provides evidence that this open translational reading frame does encode a product. This RNA is possibly 3' coterminal with the surface antigen mRNA. The two largest RNAs, which are greater than the length of the hepatitis B virus genome, are present in three independent cell lines which produce core antigen and e antigen in addition to surface antigen, but absent from two cell lines which produce only surface antigen. Therefore, it appears that these RNAs are entirely hepatitis B virus-specified, rather than being co-transcripts with cellular sequences, and also that one of them encodes the core and e antigen produced by these cells.",1983

s115515,a rift valley fever vaccine trial. i. side effects and serologic response over a six-month follow-up.,"a rift valley fever vaccine trial. i. side effects and serologic response over a six-month follow-up.. A formalin-inactivated Rift Valley fever vaccine, originally produced in primary monkey kidney cells, has been used to protect laboratory workers. A trial of a modified vaccine, newly formulated in well-characterized diploid fetal rhesus lung cells, was conducted with 114 men aged 19--24 years. Of the 107 subjects who received up to three injections of 0.1 to 1 ml vaccine (an additional seven received a placebo) one had a local hypersensitivity-type reaction and another a generalized urticarial syndrome. Both cases had a prior history of hypersensitivity states. No pyrogenicity was detected and only insignificant systemic reactions were recorded. Mild and transient local reactions ranged from 5% at the lowest dose level to 43% at the highest. Serologic response, as assessed by plaque reduction neutralizing antibody titers, was dose dependent. Within a single vaccine lot tested at multiple dose levels, peak (day 42) geometric mean titers ranged from 48 (at 0.1 ml x 3) to 436 (at 1.0 ml x 3). Reciprocal titers of greater than or equal to 40 are considered to be protective. Comparison of three lots at the 0.5 ml level indicated between lot variability, though this was not statistically significant. A sharp decline in antibody titers was observed in all vaccination groups by day 84; six months after vaccination apparently protective antibody titers were present only in groups that received 1 ml x 3 and 0.5 ml x 3 of the most antigenic lot of vaccine. These results suggest that 1) the vaccine is generally nonreactogenic, but individuals with a prior history of hypersensitivity states should be observed for allergic side effects; 2) existing vaccine supplies cannot be extended by using lower dose levels without a lower and less sustained serologic response; 3) a booster dose is necessary six months or more following the primary series; 4) although the current TSI-GSD-200 vaccine is immunogenic, a more potent vaccine is needed.",1982
s115563,a pseudogene homologous to mouse transplantation antigens: transplantation antigens are encoded by eight exons that correlate with protein domains.,"a pseudogene homologous to mouse transplantation antigens: transplantation antigens are encoded by eight exons that correlate with protein domains.. We have isolated about 30 to 40 different BALB/c mouse sperm DNA genomic clones that hybridize to cDNA clones encoding proteins homologous to transplantation antigens. One of these clones (27.1) was selected for sequence because it was polymorphic in Southern blot analysis of the DNAs from BALB/c and CBA mice. A fragment of 5.7 kilobases of this clone was completely sequenced and found to contain a pseudogene whose sequence is highly homologous to the sequences of known transplantation antigens. Pseudogene 27.1 is split into eight exons that correlate with the structurally defined protein domains of transplantation antigens. Using Southern blot hybridization on the DNAs of different inbred mouse strains, we mapped the pseudogene to the Qa-2,3 region, a part of the Tla complex on chromosome 17 that is adjacent to the major histocompatibility complex. The Qa2,3 region encodes lymphoid differentiation antigens homologous to the transplantation antigens in size, in peptide map profiles and in their association with beta2-microglobulin. These mapping studies suggest that gene 27.1 may be a pseudogene for eigher a Qa antigen or an as yet undefined transplantation antigen. Accordingly, we may have isolate genes encoding lymphoid differentiation antigens of the Tla complex as well as those encoding transplantation antigens among the 30 to 40 different genomic clones isolated from our sperm library.",1981
s115703,a monoclonal antibody to human acute lymphoblastic leukaemia antigen.,"a monoclonal antibody to human acute lymphoblastic leukaemia antigen.. Previous studies by Greaves and others have demonstrated the existence of an antigen associated with cells from many patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and some patients with chronic myelocytic leukamemia (CML) in blast crisis. Antisera to this common ALL antigen (CALLA) have been produced in rabbits and require extensive absorption which limits both the titre and quantity of antisera that can be generated and may result in variable specificity in different laboratories. The method for generation of specific antibody by somatic cell hybridisation introduced by kohler and Milstein has been successfully used to produce monoclonal antibodies against various normal human cell-surface proteins, including beta 2 microglobulin, histocompatibility antigens, thymocyte and peripheral T-cell antigens and Ia-like antigens. The present report describes the generation and characterisation of a monoclonal antibody specific for a common ALL antigen (CALLA) previously identified by conventional heteroantisera.",1980
s115777,excretion of hepatitis b surface antigen particles from mouse cells transformed with cloned viral dna.,excretion of hepatitis b surface antigen particles from mouse cells transformed with cloned viral dna.. A plasmid containing two cloned hepatitis B virus genomes in a tandem head-to-tail arrangement has been introduced into mouse fibroblasts by using cotransformation with the cloned herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene. Several copies of the plasmid were integrated into high molecular weight cellular DNA. The original tandem structure of the hepatitis B virus DNA was conserved. Hepatitis B surface antigen was synthesized by all the 15 clones examined. The other viral antigens were not detected. The surface antigen was excreted into the cell culture medium as particles having the same characteristics as those found in human serum. It is estimated that 2-4 X 10(4) particles were produced per mouse cell per 24 hr in two clones. This value corresponds to approximately 2-4 X 10(6) surface antigen polypeptides per cell per 24 hr.,1980

Eleven hybridoma antibodies directed against mouse major histocompatibility complex products of the H-2b haplotype have been produced and characterized. Of 7 antibodies reacting to H-2Kb and/or H-2Db antigens, all cross-reacted with other H-2 antigens, and 5 exhibited no correspondence with a known H-2 specificity established in the H-2 chart. Four anti-Iab antibodies all reacted with antigens encoded by the I-A subregion. Some of these antibodies showed no cross-reaction with other haplotypes, indicating reactions to private specificities of the I-Ab antigen. In addition, these anti-Ia antibodies appeared to be capable of distinguishing fine determinant differences, which corresponding alloantisera failed to reveal. A high frequency of hybridomas secreting IgM antibodies was found after fusions of spleen cells obtained from C3H anti-C3H.SW immunized mice, in contrast to the dominance of IgG hybridomas produced previously by fusions of spleen cells from mice immunized in the reverse direction. An isotype analysis of conventional cytotoxic alloantisera from the same strain combinations was therefore performed. The same correlation with respect to isotype expression was found, indicating that hybridoma antibodies reflect normal antibody responses and suggesting H-2-linked control of this expression.",1981
s115992,amplification of expression of hepatitis b surface antigen in 3t3 cells cotransfected with a dominant-acting gene and cloned viral dna.,amplification of expression of hepatitis b surface antigen in 3t3 cells cotransfected with a dominant-acting gene and cloned viral dna.. 3T3 cells containing hepatitis B virus DNA sequences can be efficiently selected by exposure to methotrexate after cotransfection with cloned viral DNA and DNA coding for a methotrexate-resistant dihydrofolate reductase. More than 75% of methotrexate-resistant cells isolated after cotransfection with a head-to-tail tandem of the hepatitis B virus genome synthesized viral surface antigen. The antigen was released into the culture medium in the form of 22-nm particles with buoyant density of 1.20 g/ml. No other virally coded proteins were detected in the cells or the culture medium. Application of selective pressure by increasing the concentration of methotrexate resulted in an amplification of viral DNA sequences and a concomitant increase in the rate of synthesis and release of hepatitis B surface antigen. The ability to produce large amounts of surface antigen appears to be a stable trait and has been maintained in these cultures through more than 30 passages.,1982
s116087,identification of human genomic clones coding the major histocompatibility antigens hla-a2 and hla-b7 by dna-mediated gene transfer.,"identification of human genomic clones coding the major histocompatibility antigens hla-a2 and hla-b7 by dna-mediated gene transfer.. We have screened a large number of isolated human genomic clones that hybridize to a cloned HLA cDNA probe for their ability to direct the synthesis of HLA-A, -B, and -C surface antigens on mouse L cells following DNA-mediated gene transfer. The surface expression of human histocompatibility antigens, monitored by indirect immunofluorescence and the fluorescence-activated cell sorter, was examined at 60 hr after transfection and on hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine-resistant (HATR) populations derived from cotransfer with the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene. Two unique genomic clones designated JY B3.2 and JY 158, isolated from the human lymphoblastoid cell line JY (homozygous HLA-A2, -B7), were shown to contain gene sequences capable of directing expression of an HLA-A, -B, -C determinant. By using allo-specific antibodies, the gene products of these clones were identified as HLA-A2 and HLA-B7, respectively. HATR clonal populations isolated from cotransfections with these genomic clones displayed varying levels of surface HLA expression that correlated with the number of intact donor HLA sequences present in the cells. In general, these levels of expression were stable during 3 months in culture. This system provides a powerful tool for the study of human surface antigen gene structure, expression, and function on a mouse cell background.",1982

CTC were able to induce the generation of primary cytotoxic effector cells and to function as 51Cr labeled target cells and cold target inhibitors. Since large numbers of CTC can be produced from as few as 1-2 X 10(6) lymphocytes within a short period of time, these reagents will enable CML studies to be performed in a broader range of situations, including those with were heretofore impossible.",1982
s116806,identification and cloning of the genetic determinant that encodes for the k88ac adherence antigen.,"identification and cloning of the genetic determinant that encodes for the k88ac adherence antigen.. Strains of Escherichia coli capable of causing diarrhea in young pigs are often able to proliferate in the upper small intestine of the infected animal due to the presence of a specific surface antigen, K88. The genetic determinants for K88 antigen production and the ability to utilize the trisaccharide raffinose (Raf) are carried on a 50-megadalton plasmid. Recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid techniques were used to insert an 8.2-megadalton HindIII fragment carrying the K88ac gene(s) from the K88/Raf plasmid pPS100 into the vector pBR322. At lease six polypeptides encoded by this fragment were expressed in minicells. These polypeptides ranged in size from 18,000 to 70,000 daltons. The K88ac antigenic subunit, which has an apparent molecular weight of 23,500, was identified by immunoprecipitation with staphylococcal protein A as the coprecipitant.",1981
s117241,antigenicity in hamsters of inactivated vaccines prepared from recombinant influenza viruses.,"antigenicity in hamsters of inactivated vaccines prepared from recombinant influenza viruses.. Inactivated vaccines prepared form influenza virus strains obtained by the recombination of A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) or A/FM/1/47 (H1N1) viruses with A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) virus, were tested for their antigenicity in hamsters. The parental origin of the genes of each cloned recombinant virus was determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and vaccines prepared from each strain by concentration, purification on sucrose density gradients and inactivation with formalin. All the recombinant strains used in these studies possessed surface haemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens derived from the A/Victoria/75 parent strain. On inoculation into hamsters, at equivalent concentrations, these vaccines varied in their ability to induce haemagglutination-inhibiting (HI)  antibodies in the serum. This variation was not dependent on concentration and was observed using neutralization and single radial haemolysis, as well as HI. The possible reasons for the findings are discussed.",1981

Fragments of hepatitis B virus DNA cloned in plasmid pBR322 carrying the gene for the viral core antigen have been placed under the control of the lac promoter of Escherichia coli. Several of the new recombinants direct higher levels of synthesis of the antigen, but the degree of enhancement varies with the different structures of the plasmids and hence the mRNAs produced. The antigen in crude bacterial lysates is a satisfactory diagnostic reagent for antibodies to the core antigen in serum samples.",1982
s117973,"radioiodination of parasite antigens with 1,3,4,6-tetrachloro-3 alpha, 6 alpha-diphenylglycoluril (iodogen): studies with zygotes of plasmodium gallinaceum.","radioiodination of parasite antigens with 1,3,4,6-tetrachloro-3 alpha, 6 alpha-diphenylglycoluril (iodogen): studies with zygotes of plasmodium gallinaceum.. The iodinating reagent 1,3,4,6-tetrachloro-3 alpha, 6 alpha-diphenylglycoluril (IODOGEN) was used to label antigens on zygotes of Plasmodium gallinaceum with parallel studies using lactoperoxidase-catalyzed radioiodination for comparison. Proteins labeled by the IODOGEN method are most probably on the surface of the zygote, as the pattern of labeled proteins analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was very similar to the pattern of lactoperoxidase-labeled proteins. Furthermore, the labeled proteins represented only a subset of the total Coomassie Blue-stained proteins. The radioiodinated zygote proteins were immunoreactive after IODOGEN or lactoperoxidase labeling. The IODOGEN method is technically much more simple than the lactoperoxidase method and does not require the addition of extraneous proteins or H2O2. The advantages of IODOGEN labeling, together with the essential equivalence of results obtained by these two methods, make the IODOGEN method attractive for labeling parasite antigens in general.",1982
s117978,transcription of the hepatitis b surface antigen gene in mouse cells transformed with cloned viral dna.,"transcription of the hepatitis b surface antigen gene in mouse cells transformed with cloned viral dna.. Mouse L cells transformed with recombinant plasmids carrying hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA fragments were used to study the transcription of the viral surface antigen gene (gene S). An HBV-specific, polyadenylated, 2.3-kilobase RNA was mapped on the HBV genome. This RNA hybridized with approximately 75% of the genome and excluded the region of the HBV core antigen gene (gene C). The 2.3-kilobase RNA species was present only in cell lines that produced hepatitis B surface antigen. An HBV-specific 2.3-kilobase RNA was also detected in human hepatoma cell line PLC/PRF/5 which produced hepatitis B surface antigen. A study of gene S expression in the transformed mouse L cells allowed us to localize the regions of initiation and termination of gene S transcription. Our results strongly suggest that the 2.3-kilobase RNA molecule is the mRNA of the major polypeptide of the envelope, which carries the viral surface antigen determinants.",1982
s118131,comparison of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and neutralization techniques for measurement of antibody to respiratory syncytial virus: implications for parenteral immunization with live virus vaccine.,"comparison of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and neutralization techniques for measurement of antibody to respiratory syncytial virus: implications for parenteral immunization with live virus vaccine.. The sensitivity of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect low levels of antibody to respiratory syncytial (RS) virus was compared with a tube dilution neutralization test (NEUT) on sera obtained from children who received a parenteral live RS virus vaccine. Among the children who developed antibody in response to live RS virus vaccine. ELISA was as sensitive as NEUT at detecting antibody increases. Some children who did not have detectable prevaccine ELISA antibody possessed NEUT antibody; these children were generally less than 12 months old, suggesting that they had low levels of maternal antibody. Low levels of NEUT or ELISA antibody were associated with the absence of antibody increases after injection of live RS virus vaccine. The quantity of antibody stimulated by this live RS virus vaccine was small compared with that which was stimulated by naturally acquired RS virus infection. We concluded that ELISA is a satisfactory test for determining antibody to RS virus in vaccine field trials, given the understanding that low levels of preexisting antibody are not detected in some instances.",1982

Attenuation of recombinants with an additional gene derived from the wt parent was less predictable. Recombinants possessing the nonstructural gene of the wt parent showed some reactogenicity at high doses, whereas cold recombinants with RNA 2 from the wt parent did not.

s118901,expression of sv40 t antigen under control of adenovirus promoters.,"expression of sv40 t antigen under control of adenovirus promoters.. We have obtained novel adenovirus-SV40 recombinant viruses that express wild-type SV40 large T and small t antigens under the control of different adenovirus promoters. Hybrids were constructed in vitro with SV40 DNA that contains the entire early coding region but lacks the transcriptional promoter. Recombinants were isolated by a strong biological selection for viruses that express SV40 T antigen. Analysis of several recombinant genomes indicates that they contain the SV40 A gene inserted in a variety of positions and orientations in the adenoviral genome. Moreover, the set of hybrid transcripts reveals an unexpected variety of splicing patterns. Some hybrid mRNAs transcribed from the adenovirus late promoter appear to contain the adenovirus tripartite leader sequence. Other hybrid mRNAs were transcribed from adenovirus early promoters. All recombinant mRNAs contain intact SV40 early sequences that have normal splice patterns and produce wild-type T antigens. Biochemical characterization of SV40 T antigens overproduced by the hybrid viruses indicates that they are structurally indistinguishable from wild-type SV40 large T antigen and are functionally equivalent to the D2 protein.",1981
s119118,monoclonal antibodies to carcinoembryonic antigen produced by somatic cell fusion.,"monoclonal antibodies to carcinoembryonic antigen produced by somatic cell fusion.. Hybridoma cell lines secreting monoclonal antibodies to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were generated by fusing mouse immune lymphocytes with the mouse myeloma variant cell line, NS-1. Antibody secreted by one cloned hybrid cell line could bind only a select portion of the CEA bound by the commercially available goat anti-CEA antiserum used in clinical assays. Radiolabeled CEA could be purified on a monoclonal antibody affinity column. Incorporation of this purified radiolabeled CEA in a double-antibody solid-phase assay with goat anti-CEA antiserum led to an approximately 2.5-fold increase in sensitivity of the assay. Genetically stable hybrid clones may be sources of virtually unlimited quantities of such antibodies which may have potential utility in improving the cancer specificity of clinical assays.",1981
s119792,gene composition of high-yielding influenza vaccine strains obtained by recombination.,"gene composition of high-yielding influenza vaccine strains obtained by recombination.. The genetic composition of 11 high-yielding recombinants of influenza virus was determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the 32P-labeled RNAs obtained from the recombinants and their parental viruses. The high-yield recombinants that were selected for potential use as vaccine strains contained the surface hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens of the low-yielding parental viruses. The increased growth capacity of the recombinants is associated with the presence of genes derived from the high-yielding laboratory strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34. Although increased growth capacity in these recombinants could not be attributed to specific genes or gene combinations, all of the high-yielding recombinants examined derived the M gene from the A/Puerto Rico/8/34 parent.",1980

A DNA copy of the gene coding for the influenza A/Aichi/2/68 haemagglutinin protein was cloned in the plasmid pBR322 and the complete nucleotide sequence determined. Comparison of this primary structure and the deduced amino acid sequence with the haemagglutinin gene and protein of strains belonging to the same (H3) subtype and to different subtypes, of both human (H2) and avian (Hav1) origin, documents further at the molecular level the two independent modes of antigenic variation of the virus--drift and shift.",1980

Double-stranded DNA copies of the RNA gene coding for the haemagglutinin glycoproteins from human H2 and H3 pandemic strains of influenza virus have been cloned. DNA sequence analysis provides the first reported complete nucleotide sequence of an H2 haemagglutinin gene and a partial sequence (45%) of the H3 gene. The H2 haemagglutinin gene consists of 1,773 nucleotides containing an uninterrupted coding sequence of 1,686 nucleotides specifying a protein of 562 amino acids. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of these haemagglutinins with those of other H3 and avian strains reveals the extent of sequence changes in antigenic shifts and drifts.",1980

A computer search was carried out for homologies between HLA-A and HLA-B antigen sequences and the sequences of constant and variable regions of immunoglobulins and of all other sequenced proteins. Searches were made both with relatively short peptide sequences from the HLA antigens and with those longer peptide sequences which were available in 1978. Significant homology of HLA antigen sequences to immunoglobulin constant region sequences was found in two cases: (1) a short decapeptide sequence which includes the fourth cysteine residue of HLA-B7 and (2) an 89-amino-acid residue (Ac-2) C-terminal fragment of the papainsolubilized HLA-B7 molecule. The difficulty of establishing statistically significant sequence homology with relatively short peptide sequences is emphasized by computer-based comparisons of the decapeptide sequence with randomly generated peptide sequences. It is concluded that statistically significant homology with short sequences can be assured only when extraordinarily high degrees of homology are present and additional constraints are included in the matches, for example, matches at relatively rare amino acid residues such as Cys, His and Trp. The homology of the 89-amino-acid residue sequence to constant region sequences of immunoglobulins is as great as or greater than that of beta 2-microglobulin. These findings and the unique domain structure involving a disulphide loop of comparable size strongly favour a common evolutionary origin for this region of HLA-A and -B, beta 2-microglobulin and immunoglobulin constant regions.",1980
s120739,development of a safe live leishmania vaccine line by gene replacement.,"development of a safe live leishmania vaccine line by gene replacement.. Vaccination with live Leishmania major has been shown to yield effective immunization in humans; however, this has been discontinued because of problems associated with virulence of the available vaccine lines. To circumvent this, we tested the ability of a dhfr-ts- null mutant of L. major, obtained by gene targeting, to infect and then to vaccinate mice against challenge with virulent L. major. Survival and replication of dhfr-ts- in macrophages in vitro were dependent upon thymidine, with parasites differentiating into amastigotes prior to destruction. dhfr-ts- parasites persisted in BALB/c mice for up to 2 months, declining with a half-life of 2-3 days. Nonetheless, dhfr-ts- was incapable of causing disease in both susceptible and immunodeficient (nu/nu) BALB/c mice. Animal infectivity could be partially restored by thymidine supplementation. When inoculated by the i.v., s.c., or i.m. routes into mice, dhfr-ts- could elicit substantial resistance to a subsequent challenge with virulent L. major. Thus, Leishmania bearing auxotrophic gene knockouts can be safe and induce protective immunity. Potentially, dhfr-ts- could be used as a platform for delivery of immunogens relevant to other diseases.",1995
s120925,gene fusion of cholera toxin b subunit and hbv pres2 epitope and the antigenicity of fusion protein.,"gene fusion of cholera toxin b subunit and hbv pres2 epitope and the antigenicity of fusion protein.. A unique EcoRI site was introduced at the 3' end of cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) gene by site-directed mutagenesis, polynucleotides encoding 120-145aa epitope of HBV PreS2 were chemically synthesized and fused to the 3' end of cholera toxin B subunit gene. The fused gene was over-expressed (about 30 micrograms ml-1) in E. coli, and more than 95% of the fusion protein was secreted into the medium. The fusion protein expressed was purified by affinity chromatography. The chimera protein obtained bound to ganglioside GM1, and had the antigenicity of both cholera toxin B subunit and HBV PreS2 as confirmed by ELISA. After mice were immunized intramuscularly with the fusion protein, anti-CTB antibody and anti-PreS2 antibody were produced. These results indicated that the fusion protein retained not only the biological function of CTB but also the antigenicity and the immunogenicity of cholera toxin B subunit and HBV PreS2 epitope. This work provided a sound basis for further studies on the construction of engineered peptide vaccine.",1995

Among the known colonization factors of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), CFA/I and CS3 (the common antigen in the CFA/II family of fimbrial antigens) are two of the most prevalent fimbrial antigens found in clinical isolates but are never expressed by the same wild-type strain. We manipulated the genetic determinants encoding CS3 and CFA/I fimbriae so that these two important colonization factors are expressed simultaneously in attenuated Salmonella typhi live oral vaccine strain CVD 908, including after growth in liquid medium (CFA/I is poorly expressed by wild-type ETEC in broth culture). The recombinant fimbrial structures produced by CVD 908 are morphologically indistinguishable from the CS3 fibrillae and CFA/I rod-like fimbriae produced by ETEC, and are recognized by monospecific CS3 and CFA/I antibodies. This prototype construct may prove useful in investigating the live vector approach to immunoprophylaxis of ETEC diarrheal disease.",1995
s120928,construction and characterization of a salmonella typhi-based human immunodeficiency virus type 1 vector vaccine.,"construction and characterization of a salmonella typhi-based human immunodeficiency virus type 1 vector vaccine.. Since the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is transmitted either parenterally or sexually, both systemic and mucosal immune responses might be required to provide protective immunity. One option is to express HIV proteins in attenuated Salmonella vectors that elicit immune responses in both compartments. The first step to constructing such a strain was achieved by integrating a gene expression cassette encoding recombinant HIV-1 gp120 (rgp120) into the aroC locus of an attenuated vaccine strain of S. typhi. This rgp120 expression cassette utilizes the strong constitutive promoter, P1pp/lacUV5, and produces rgp120 to 0.05-01% of the total bacterial cell protein. Immunoblot analysis shows that the S. typhi strains containing the integrated cassette express a protein that is both recognized by anti-gp120 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and is the appropriate size for nonglycosylated full-length gp120 (52 kDa). Immunoblot analysis also demonstrates that the recombinant S. typhi strains express the rgp120 as monomers and multimers found predominantly in the insoluble fraction of the bacteria. Antigen-capture ELISA, using antibodies specific for continuous epitopes on gp120, revealed that the exposure of these epitopes on S. typhi-expressed rgp120 differs from exposure of these epitopes on baculovirus-expressed rgp120 that binds CD4. Epitopes in the first conserved region (109-113) and the third conserved/fourth variable regions (376-380, 382-384, 395-400) are more """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""surface-exposed"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""", while one epitope in the third variable region (313-324) is more """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""buried"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" relative to the corresponding epitopes of baculovirus expressed gp120.

s120932,p-fimbriae of escherichia coli as carriers for gonadotropin releasing hormone: development of a recombinant contraceptive vaccine.,"p-fimbriae of escherichia coli as carriers for gonadotropin releasing hormone: development of a recombinant contraceptive vaccine.. The demand for an effective and low cost means of fertility control of domestic animals has raised interest in the development of contraceptive vaccines. A promising candidate for a vaccine component is the brain peptide gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), which plays a central role in the regulation of reproductive functions in vertebrates. Neutralization of GnRH by vaccine-induced antibodies is expected to prevent the reproductive activity in a wide range of species. A GnRH-protein conjugate was prepared by means of recombinant DNA technology. The oligonucleotides encoding GnRH were inserted in hypervariable regions of the subunit gene of P-fimbriae of Escherichia coli. Hybrid fimbriae encoded by the manipulated fimbrial gene clusters were expressed efficiently on the cell surface of Escherichia coli. Vaccination of female rats and bull calves with purified hybrid GnRH-fimbriae strongly affected the reproductive characteristics. We conclude that P-fimbriae represent a very attractive carrier system for application of GnRH in a new type of vaccine.",1995
s120938,isolation of caliciviruses from skunks that are antigenically and genotypically related to san miguel sea lion virus.,"isolation of caliciviruses from skunks that are antigenically and genotypically related to san miguel sea lion virus.. Caliciviruses were isolated from feces of skunks imported from the north central United States to Canada. Virus isolation was accomplished using adenovirus-transformed human kidney (293) cells, swine testes and Vero cells. Plaque size variants were presented, but there was no apparent difference in virus morphology by negative stain or immune electron microscopy. Pigs infected with skunk calicivirus had a slightly elevated body temperature at 3 days postinfection. Although the infected animals seroconverted, no overt clinical signs were observed. Purified infectious genomic skunk calicivirus RNA behaved exactly as San Miguel sea lion virus (SMSV) 1 and 4 genomic RNA in cell culture transfection studies. Of the cell types examined, only primary porcine kidney, 293 and Vero cells supported viral replication. No viral replication was detected in cells of bovine, equine, ovine, caprine or feline origin. The skunk caliciviruses contained a single capsid protein with a relative mobility similar to SMSV virus 1 and 4 capsid proteins. The capsid protein was positive by Western blot analysis with SMSV and vesicular exanthema of swine virus (VESV) antisera. Purified RNA from skunk calicivirus infected cells was subjected to reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction. Nucleotide sequences were identified that had greater than 85% similarity to the 2C and RNA polymerase gene regions of SMSV 1 and 4 and VESV A48. Predicted amino acid sequences of these regions were greater than 95% similar and the partial coding sequence of the polymerase gene contained the YGDD sequence common to positive-strand RNA virus polymerases.",1995
s121228,"highly attenuated hiv type 2 recombinant poxviruses, but not hiv-2 recombinant salmonella vaccines, induce long-lasting protection in rhesus macaques.","highly attenuated hiv type 2 recombinant poxviruses, but not hiv-2 recombinant salmonella vaccines, induce long-lasting protection in rhesus macaques.. Immunization schemes employing priming with vector-based vaccine candidates followed by subunit booster administrations have been explored and shown to have merit in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and simian immunodeficiency virus systems. In this study, we have assessed the priming capacity of highly attenuated poxvirus vector (NYVAC and ALVAC)-based HIV-2 recombinants, as well as Salmonella typhimurium HIV-2 recombinants in rhesus macaques. ALVAC- and NYVAC-based vaccine candidates expressing the HIV-2 gag, pol, and env genes or NYVAC-based recombinants expressing either gp160 or gp120 were used to immunize rhesus macaques in combination protocols with alum-adjuvanted HIV-2 rgp160. Following intravenous challenge exposure with 100 infectious doses of the HIV-2SBL6669 parental virus genotype mixture, seven of eight animals were protected from infection. The seven protected animals were rechallenged 6 months postprimary challenge, without additional booster inoculations, with the same dose of the HIV-2SBL6669 parental virus. Five of the seven animals remained protected against HIV-2 infection at 6 months following the second challenge. In contrast, oral immunization with recombinant Salmonella expressing the HIV-2 gag and the gp120 portion of the envelope either alone or in combination with alum-adjuvanted rgp160 failed to confer protection. These results suggest that the NYVAC- and ALVAC-based recombinants may confer long-lasting protection and that these two highly attenuated poxvirus vaccine vectors may represent promising candidates for developing an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome vaccine.",1995
s121605,t cell receptor repertoire for a viral epitope in humans is diversified by tolerance to a background major histocompatibility complex antigen.,"t cell receptor repertoire for a viral epitope in humans is diversified by tolerance to a background major histocompatibility complex antigen.. Two unusual characteristics of the memory response to the immunodominant Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) epitope FLRGRAYGL, which associates with HLA B8, have provided an unique opportunity to investigate self tolerance and T cell receptor (TCR) plasticity in humans. First, the response is exceptionally restricted, dominated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) with identical TCR protein sequences (Argaet, V. P., C. W. Schmidt, S. R. Burrows, S. L. Silins, M. G. Kurilla, D. L. Doolan, A. Suhrbier, D. J. Moss, E. Kieff, T. B. Sculley, and I. S. Misko. 1994. J. Exp. Med. 180:2335-2340). Second, CTL expressing this receptor are cross-reactive with the alloantigen HLA B* 4402 on uninfected cells (Burrows, S. R., R. Khanna, J. M. Burrows, and D. J. Moss. 1994. J. Exp. Med. 179:1155-1161). No CTL using this conserved public TCR could be reactivated from the peripheral blood of EBV exposed individuals expressing both HLA B8 and B*4402, demonstrating the clonal inactivation of potentially self-reactive T cells in humans. A significant FLRGRAYGL-specific response was still apparent, however, and TCR sequence analysis of multiple CTL clones revealed an oligoclonal TCR repertoire for this determinant within these individuals, using diverse V and J gene segments and CDR3 regions. In addition, a significant public TCR component was identified in which several distinct alpha/beta rearrangements are shared by CTL clones from a number of unrelated HLA B8+, B*4402+ donors. The striking dominance of public TCR in the response to this EBV epitope suggests a strong genetic bias in TCR gene recombination. Fine specificity analysis using peptide analogues showed that, of six different antigen receptors for FLRGRAYGL/HLA B8, none associate closely with the peptide's full array of potential TCR contact residues. Whereas the HLA B*4402-cross-reactive receptor binds amino acids toward the COOH terminus of the peptide, others preferentially favor an NH2-terminal determinant, presumably evading an area that mimics a structure presented on HLA B*4402. Thus, tolerance to a background major histocompatibility antigen can effectively diversify the TCR repertoire for a foreign epitope by deflecting the response away from an immunodominant combination of TCR-binding residues.",1995
s121606,identification of a cd4+ t cell-stimulating antigen of pathogenic bacteria by expression cloning.,"identification of a cd4+ t cell-stimulating antigen of pathogenic bacteria by expression cloning.. Identifying the immunogenic proteins that elicit pathogen-specific T cell responses is key to rational vaccine design. While several approaches have succeeded in identifying major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I bound peptides that stimulate CD8+ T cells, these approaches have been difficult to extend to peptides presented by MHC class II molecules that stimulate CD4+ T cells. We describe here a novel strategy for identifying CD4+ T cell-stimulating antigen genes. Using Listeria monocytogenes-specific, lacZ-inducible T cells as single-cell probes, we screened a Listeria monocytogenes genomic library as recombinant Escherichia coli that were fed to macrophages. The antigen gene was isolated from the E. coli clone that, when ingested by the macrophages, allowed generation of the appropriate peptide/MHC class II complex and T cell activation. We show that the antigenic peptide is derived from a previously unknown listeria gene product with characteristics of a membrane-bound protein.",1995
s121703,"immunogenicity, antigenicity, and protection efficacy of baculovirus expressed vp4 trypsin cleavage products, vp5(1)* and vp8* from rhesus rotavirus.","immunogenicity, antigenicity, and protection efficacy of baculovirus expressed vp4 trypsin cleavage products, vp5(1)* and vp8* from rhesus rotavirus.. Rhesus rotavirus (RRV) VP4 trypsin cleavage product VP5(1)*, a truncated form of VP5*, was expressed in baculovirus and found by immunoprecipitation to be antigenically similar to VP5* on the virion. Immunization of mice with VP5(1)* elicited neutralizing antibody that was found to be cross-reactive with viruses representing P genotypes 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8. Baculovirus expressed trypsin cleavage products, VP8* (amino acids 1-246) and VP5(1)* (amino acids 247-474), were tested for their ability to elicit a protective response in a murine model of passive protection. These results were compared to those obtained with baculovirus expressed RRV VP4. Dams immunized with baculovirus expressed RRV VP4 gave birth to pups protected from RRV virus challenge. Neither VP5(1)* nor VP8* was as effective at generating protective immunity as full length VP4. However, antibody to VP5(1)* was more effective than antibody to VP8* at mediating protection even though the neutralizing antibody titers as measured by hemagglutination inhibition and focus reduction neutralization were similar.",1995
s121743,analysis of feline calicivirus capsid protein genes: identification of variable antigenic determinant regions of the protein.,"analysis of feline calicivirus capsid protein genes: identification of variable antigenic determinant regions of the protein.. Three isolates of feline calicivirus (FCV) designated NADC, KCD and CFI/68 were compared for biochemical, serological and genetic variation within the capsid protein gene. The M(r) of the capsid protein from purified virions was approximately 66,000 for the NADC virus isolate, which differed slightly from the relative mobilities of the purified capsid proteins of the KCD and CFI/68 isolates. Polyclonal antisera from either cats infected or rabbits hyperimmunized with the CFI/68 isolate cross-reacted with all three isolates by Western blot analysis. However, these polyclonal antisera to CFI/68 varied considerably in their virus-neutralization titres to the KCD and NADC isolates. Nucleotide sequence data confirmed the genetic variability among these FCV isolates. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of the capsid protein among isolates revealed two regions of sequence divergence that probably contain the antigenically variable determinants. These hypervariable regions may vary by as much as 55% among isolates of FCV. The amino acid sequence diversity in the hypervariable regions of the KCD and NADC isolates correlated well with the virus-neutralization data and suggests that polyvalent vaccines may be more protective than the commonly used monovalent vaccines.",1993
s122200,internal image anti-idiotype antibodies related to renal-cell carcinoma-associated antigen g250.,"internal image anti-idiotype antibodies related to renal-cell carcinoma-associated antigen g250.. The potential usefulness of internal-image anti-idiotype antibodies (Ab2s) in modulating hosts' immune responses to tumor-associated antigen (TAA) have stimulated considerable interest in the development and characterization of Ab2s. Six different mouse monoclonal Ab2s (NUH31, 44, 51, 71, 82 and 91) were generated against murine monoclonal antibody G250 (MAbG250) which recognizes a human renal-cell carcinoma-associated antigen. All 6 Ab2s showed specificity for the MAbG250 paratope in Western-blot analysis. In inhibition assays, all Ab2s were able to compete with the nominal antigen, albeit with differing efficiency. Based on cross-blocking studies for idiotope mapping, the Ab2s could be divided into 2 groups (group I; NUH31, 51, 71, group 2; NUH44, 82, 91). However, cross-reactivity between these 2 groups was observed, indicating that they recognized partly overlapping epitopes on the paratope of MAbG250. Sera from rabbits immunized with Ab2s showed reactivity with G250 antigen-positive cell lysates, but not with antigen-negative cell lysates. Additional studies revealed that all Ab2s were able to induce anti-anti-idiotype antibodies resembling MAbG250 (Ab1'). These findings suggest that the Ab2s functionally mimic the original G250 antigen and may be of use in the immunotherapy of human renal-cell carcinoma.",1994
s122279,"the human ox40 homolog: cdna structure, expression and chromosomal assignment of the act35 antigen.","the human ox40 homolog: cdna structure, expression and chromosomal assignment of the act35 antigen.. Tissue distribution and expression on mitogen and virally stimulated lymphocytes render the ACT35 molecule a human lymphocyte activation antigen which as yet could not be clustered. Expression cloning of the ACT35 antigen from a pCDM8 library of the HUT-102 cell line revealed strong homology of the cDNA and its encoded protein sequence with the formerly described rat OX40 antigen. The 1.4-kb nucleotide sequence and the deduced 277-amino acid sequence of the single transmembrane protein were 65% and 63% identical, in human and in rat, respectively. Conservation included one N-linked glycosylation site and one protein kinase C phosphorylation site. When expressed in COS-1 cells, the cDNA presented properties comparable to the native ACT35 antigen and the rat OX40 molecule (relative molecular mass 48,000). Thus, the ACT35 protein corresponds to the hitherto unknown human OX40 antigen and is, therefore, another member of the tumor necrosis factor/nerve growth factor receptor (TNFR/NGFR) family. After applying fluorescence in situ hybridization, the human ACT35/OX40 gene could be mapped to chromosome band 1p36 and is, thus, linked to the genes for TNFR II and CD30.",1994
s122436,construction of polyepitope fusion antigens of human cytomegalovirus ppul32: reactivity with human antibodies.,"construction of polyepitope fusion antigens of human cytomegalovirus ppul32: reactivity with human antibodies.. We have previously shown that single linear epitopes of the major human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) antigens, expressed as fusion proteins or synthesized as oligopeptides, can be valuable diagnostic material in the serology of HCMV infection (M. P. Landini, M. X. Guan, G. Jahn, W. Lindenmaier, M. Mach, A. Ripalti, A. Necker, T. Lazzarotto, and B. Plachter, J. Clin. Microbiol. 28:1375-1379, 1990; M. P. Landini, T. Lazzarotto, A. Ripalti, M. X. Guan, and M. La Placa, J. Clin. Microbiol. 27:2324-2327, 1989; A. Ripalti, M. P. Landini, E. S. Mocarski, and M. La Placa, J. Gen. Virol. 70:1247-1251, 1989). In this work we addressed the question of whether the expression of more than one linear epitope on a single fusion protein could increase the reactivity of genetically engineered antigenic material with human antibody. To answer this question we fused sequences expressing two different epitopes contained in the basic phosphoprotein of 150 kDa encoded by UL32 (M. S. Chee, A. T. Bankier, S. Beck, R. Bohni, C. M. Brown, T. Cerny, T. Hornsel, C. A. Hutchinson, T. Kouzarides, J. A. Martignetti, and B. G. Barrell, Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 154:125-169, 1990; G. Jahn, T. Kouzarides, M. Mach, B.-C. Scholl, B.

Virol. 61:1358-1367, 1987), ppUL32, which was repeatedly shown to be the strongest immunogen present in the viral particle. We also made fusions with sequences expressing a single epitope repeated once, twice, or three times. The different fusion proteins were tested with HCMV-positive human sera. We found that fusion proteins expressing different epitopes together were recognized by a larger number of serum specimens and with more intense reactions in Western blot (immunoblot) experiments. We also found evidence that expression on the same polypeptide of the two distinct epitopes produced a stronger antigen than the mere addition of two fusion proteins which each carried one copy of one of these epitopes. Furthermore, we found that while the same epitope expressed two or three times on the same fusion protein was not better recognized by immunoglobulin G than the single epitope, immunoglobulin M reactivities to the double and triple epitopes were enhanced.",1994

Extant Escherichia coli K12 strains are phenotypically rough, their lipopolysaccharide having a complete core structure, but no O antigen. We used DNA hybridization and DNA sequencing to show that the rough phenotype of this strain is due to the presence of one of two independent mutations in the rfb gene cluster. The rfb-50 mutation, consisting of an IS5 insertion at the downstream end of rfb, is present in strain EMG2, which is representative of most K12 derivatives. The rfb-51 mutation is a deletion at the upstream end of rfb, and was found in strain WG1. A gene cloned from strain WG1 could complement the rfb-50 mutation in strain EMG2, and the complemented strain produced O antigen which was typed as O16 with cross reaction to O17.",1994

s122631,a general strategy to identify mimotopes of pathological antigens using only random peptide libraries and human sera.,"a general strategy to identify mimotopes of pathological antigens using only random peptide libraries and human sera.. A strategy to identify disease-specific epitopes from phage-displayed random peptide libraries using human sera is described. Peptides on phage (phagotopes) that react with antibodies present in patient sera are purified from > 10(7) different sequences by affinity selection and immunological screening of plaques. Disease-specific phagotopes can be identified out of this pool through an 'antigen independent' procedure which avails itself only of patient and normal human sera. Using this strategy, we have selected antigenic mimics (mimotopes) of two different epitopes from the human hepatitis B virus envelope protein (HBsAg). We could show that a humoral response to these mimotopes is widespread in the immunized population, suggesting that the strategy identifies phagotopes that have a potential role as diagnostic reagents. Immunization of mice with the selected phagotopes elicited a strong specific response against the HBsAg. These results open new inroads into disease-related epitope discovery and provide the potential for vaccine development without a requirement for the use of, or even information about, the aetiological agent or its antigens.",1994
s122651,antigenic structure of envelope glycoprotein e1 of hog cholera virus.,"antigenic structure of envelope glycoprotein e1 of hog cholera virus.. Envelope glycoprotein E1 (gp51 to gp54) is the most antigenic protein of hog cholera virus or classical swine fever virus (CSFV). Four antigenic domains, A to D, have been mapped on E1 with a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised against CSFV strain Brescia. The boundaries of these domains have been established by extensive studies on binding of MAbs to transiently expressed deletion mutants of E1 (P. A. van Rijn, E. J. de Meijer, H. G. P. van Gennip, and R. J. M. Moormann, J. Gen. Virol. 74:2053-2060, 1993). In this study, we used neutralizing MAbs of domains A, B, and C to isolate MAb-resistant mutants (MAR mutants) of CSFV strain Brescia and Chinese vaccine strain (""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""C""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""). The E1 genes of MAR mutants were cloned in a eukaryotic expression vector, and the effects of MAR mutations on epitopes were studied with a panel of 19 MAbs by immunostaining of COS1 cells transiently expressing these mutant E1s. Except for the MAR mutation Cys-->Arg at position 792, which abolished binding of all MAbs of domains A and D, amino acid substitutions affected only MAbs belonging to the same domain as the MAb used to select the MAR mutant. However, a MAR mutation in a particular domain did not per se abolish binding of all MAbs recognizing that domain. Furthermore, MAR mutants possessed conservative as well as nonconservative amino acid substitutions. To investigate the significance of a secondary structure for the binding of MAbs, all cysteine residues in the N-terminal antigenic part of E1 were mutated to serine. We found that the cysteines at positions 693 and 737 were essential for binding by MAbs of domains B and C, whereas those at positions 792, 818, 828, and 856 appeared to be essential for the binding of most MAbs of domains A and D. These results fully comply with the previously proposed two-unit structure of the N-terminal half of E1. One unit consists of antigenic domains B and C, whereas the other unit consists of the highly conserved domain A and domain D. We conclude that the first six cysteines are critical for the correct folding of E1. A model of the antigenic structure of E1 is presented and discussed.",1994
s122764,epitope specificity and isoforms of the mycobacterial 19-kilodalton antigen.,"epitope specificity and isoforms of the mycobacterial 19-kilodalton antigen.. The topography and specificity of B- and T-cell stimulatory epitopes from the 19-kDa protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were investigated by using overlapping synthetic peptides. Murine antisera identified two cryptic epitopes (residues 11 to 30 and 61 to 80) and one species-specific immunodominant epitope (residues 140 to 159). Immunoglobulins G1 and G2a antibody isotypes varied for the respective peptide immunogens but without relationship to the T-cell cytokine profiles which were characterized by high gamma interferon and low interleukin 5 levels. Antisera to recombinant M. tuberculosis 19-kDa protein (rGST-19) cross-reacted with homologous proteins of similar size from organisms of the Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed differences in the number, relative mobility, and charge of isoforms of the 19-kDa protein, possibly reflecting posttranslational modifications. The immunodominant T-cell epitope from the M. tuberculosis 19-kDa protein (residues 61 to 80) and the corresponding peptide sequence from Mycobacterium avium subsp. intracellulare (residues 64 to 83), differing at five residues, were both recognized in a genetically permissive manner. Peptides 61-80 and 64-83 stimulated cross-reactive responses in BALB/c (H-2d) mice, while in the C57BL/10 (H-2b) strain, responses to peptide 61-80 were species specific. In purified protein derivative-positive healthy individuals, the M. avium subsp. intracellulare peptide stimulated stronger responses than did the M. tuberculosis peptide, whereas patients with active tuberculosis had enhanced in vitro T-cell responses to both peptides.",1994
s122788,the cd40 antigen and its ligand.,"the cd40 antigen and its ligand.. CD40 is an integral membrane protein found on the surface of B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, follicular dendritic cells, hematopoietic progenitor cells, epithelial cells, and carcinomas. It is a 45-50 kDa glycoprotein of 277 aa, which is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. The CD40 gene maps to human chromosome 20q11-2-q13-2. CD40 binds to a ligand (CD40-L) which is an approximately 35 kDa glycoprotein of 261 aa, a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily. The CD40-L gene maps to human chromosome Xq24. This CD40-L is expressed on activated T cells, mostly CD4+ but also some CD8+ as well as basophils/mast cells. The CD40-L is defective in the X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome. Cross-linking of CD40 with immobilized anti-CD40 or cells expressing CD40-L induces B cells to proliferate strongly, and addition of IL-4 or IL-13 allows the generation of factor-dependent long-term normal human B cell lines and the secretion of IgE following isotype switching. Addition of IL-10 results in very high immunoglobulin production with limited cell proliferation. IL-10 induces naive B cells to produce IgG3, IgG1, and IgA1, and further addition of TGF beta permits the secretion of IgA2. Several evidences suggest that CD40-dependent activation of B cells is important for the generation of memory B cells within the germinal centers: (i) CD40 activated germinal center B cells cultured in the presence of IL-4 acquire a memory B cell phenotype, (ii) CD40 activated B cells can undergo isotype switching, (iii) the deficit of CD40-L results in the hyper-IgM syndrome characterized by lack of germinal centers in secondary lymphoid organ follicles and lack of IgG, IgA, and IgE, and (iv) CD40-L positive T cells are present in secondary follicles. Thymic epithelial cells, activated monocytes, and dendritic cells express CD40 antigen which may be involved in an enhanced cytokine production by these cells, allowing an amplification of T cell proliferation. Finally, as other members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family have been shown to bind several ligands, it is possible that CD40 may bind other ligands that may trigger CD40 on different cell types such as hematopoietic cells or epithelial cells.",1994
s122828,structure of the o antigen of escherichia coli k-12 and the sequence of its rfb gene cluster.,"structure of the o antigen of escherichia coli k-12 and the sequence of its rfb gene cluster.. Escherichia coli K-12 has long been known not to produce an O antigen. We recently identified two independent mutations in different lineages of K-12 which had led to loss of O antigen synthesis (D. Liu and P. R. Reeves, Microbiology 140:49-57, 1994) and constructed a strain with all rfb (O antigen) genes intact which synthesized a variant of O antigen O16, giving cross-reaction with anti-O17 antibody. We determined the structure of this O antigen to be -->2)-beta-D-Galf-(1-->6)-alpha-D-Glcp- (1-->3)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1-->3)-alpha-D-GlcpNAc-(1-->, with an O-acetyl group on C-2 of the rhamnose and a side chain alpha-D-Glcp on C-6 of GlcNAc. O antigen synthesis is rfe dependent, and D-GlcpNAc is the first sugar of the biological repeat unit. We sequenced the rfb (O antigen) gene cluster and found 11 open reading frames. Four rhamnose pathway genes are identified by similarity to those of other strains, the rhamnose transferase gene is identified by assay of its product, and the identities of other genes are predicted with various degrees of confidence. We interpret earlier observations on interaction between the rfb region of Escherichia coli K-12 and those of E. coli O4 and E. coli Flexneri. All K-12 rfb genes were of low G+C content for E. coli. The rhamnose pathway genes were similar in sequence to those of (Shigella) Dysenteriae 1 and Flexneri, but the other genes showed distant or no similarity. We suggest that the K-12 gene cluster is a member of a family of rfb gene clusters, including those of Dysenteriae 1 and Flexneri, which evolved outside E. coli and was acquired by lateral gene transfer.",1994
s123090,t-cell-epitope mapping of the major secreted mycobacterial antigen ag85a in tuberculosis and leprosy.,"t-cell-epitope mapping of the major secreted mycobacterial antigen ag85a in tuberculosis and leprosy.. Lymphoproliferation and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) secretion in response to 28 overlapping 20-mer synthetic peptides covering the complete sequence of the mature (295-amino-acid) 85A component of the major secreted, fibronectin-binding antigen 85 complex from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis BCG (MTAg85A) was examined by using peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures from healthy tuberculin- and lepromin-positive volunteers and from patients with tuberculosis and leprosy. Peptide recognition was largely promiscuous, with a variety of human leukocyte antigen haplotypes reacting to the same peptides. PBMC from all tuberculin-positive subjects reacted to Ag85, and the majority proliferated in response to peptide 6 (amino acids 51 to 70), peptides 13, 14, and 15 (amino acids 121 to 160), or peptides 20 and 21 (amino acids 191 to 220). PBMC from tuberculosis patients demonstrated a variable reactivity to Ag85 and its peptides, and the strongest proliferation was observed against peptide 7 (amino acids 61 to 80). MTAg85A peptides were also recognized by PBMC from healthy lepromin-positive volunteers and paucibacillary leprosy patients (again in a promiscuous manner), but despite a 90% homology between the 85A proteins of M. leprae and M. tuberculosis, the peptides recognized were different. PBMC from lepromin-positive healthy contacts reacted against peptide 2 (amino acids 11 to 30), peptide 5 (amino acids 41 to 60), and peptides 25 and 26 (amino acids 241 to 270). PBMC from paucibacillary patients reacted preferentially against peptide 1 (amino acids 1 to 20) and peptide 5. Multibacillary patients were not reactive to Ag85 or the MT85A peptides. IFN-gamma production was generally detected simultaneously with positive lymphoproliferative responses, although peptide 1 mostly stimulated proliferation and peptides 27 and 28 mostly elicited an IFN-gamma response. In conclusion, regions 41 to 80 and 241 to 295 demonstrated powerful and promiscuous T-cell-stimulatory properties, resulting in proliferative responses and IFN-gamma secretion, respectively, in the majority of reactive subjects tested in this study. These results could be of value in the development of a subunit vaccine for tuberculosis and leprosy.",1994
s123144,vaccine technologies: view to the future.,vaccine technologies: view to the future.. The development of vaccines to prevent infectious diseases has been one of the most important contributions of biomedical science. Recent advances in the basic sciences are now fueling the development of a new generation of vaccines that will be based on rational design approaches. Two factors are making this possible: an improved understanding of the microbial factors required for virulence and the nature of the immune response to infection. The status of new vaccine technologies is summarized here.,1994
s123240,clonal selection and amplification of phage displayed antibodies by linking antigen recognition and phage replication.,"clonal selection and amplification of phage displayed antibodies by linking antigen recognition and phage replication.. The immune response generates a tremendous array of antibody specificities by VDJ-gene rearrangements. A similar diversity can be obtained by expressing entire V-gene repertoires on the surface of filamentous bacteriophages creating large antibody libraries. Here we describe how the clonal selection mechanisms of the humoral immune response can also be mimicked in the phage display system by linking antigen-recognition and phage replication. We have achieved this by displaying antibody libraries on engineered, non-infectious phage with gene 3 deletions. Individual, antigen-specific phage are made replication competent by allowing a fusion protein, consisting of the antigen and phage coat protein 3, to bind the displayed antibody fragment. This fusion protein bridges the phage and F-pili of the bacteria and allows infection to be initiated and the phage to be clonally amplified with specific enrichment factors of approximately 10(10) after only two rounds.",1994
s123379,vaccines prepared from chimeras of foot-and-mouth disease virus (fmdv) induce neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity to multiple serotypes of fmdv.,"vaccines prepared from chimeras of foot-and-mouth disease virus (fmdv) induce neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity to multiple serotypes of fmdv.. The G-H loop of VP1 (residues 132 to 159) of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a prominent feature on the virion surface and has an important role in vaccine efficacy, generation of antigenic variants, and cell binding. Using an infectious cDNA of FMDV, we have constructed serotype A viruses in which the G-H loop has been substituted with the homologous sequences from serotype O or C. These chimeric viruses replicated to high titer and displayed plaque morphologies similar to those of wild-type viruses, demonstrating that the functions provided by the loop can be readily exchanged between serotypes. Monoclonal antibody analyses showed that epitopes contained within the loop were transferred to the chimeras and that epitopes encoded by the type A backbone were maintained. Chemically inactivated vaccines prepared from chimeric viruses induced antibodies in guinea pigs that neutralized both type A and either type O or type C viruses. Swine inoculated with the A/C chimera vaccine also produced cross-reactive antibodies, were protected from challenge with the type A virus, and partially protected against challenge with type C. These studies emphasize the importance of epitopes outside of the G-H loop in protective immunity in swine, which is a natural host of FMDV.",1994
s123546,"idiotype-cytokine fusion proteins as cancer vaccines. relative efficacy of il-2, il-4, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.","idiotype-cytokine fusion proteins as cancer vaccines. relative efficacy of il-2, il-4, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.. Idiotypic determinants, antigenic sites expressed on the variable region of Ig molecules of malignant B cells, represent tumor-specific Ags but are weak immunogens. We have previously shown that the immunogenicity can be dramatically increased by fusing tumor Id to granulocyte macrophage (GM)-CSF. Here, we demonstrate that fusion proteins with IL-2 or IL-4 can also be highly immunogenic. Co-immunization of these fusion proteins with another Id demonstrated the importance of physical linkage between the cytokine and relevant Ag for this enhancement. All three fusion proteins are capable of eliciting significant levels of specific Abs against the Id without the use of carrier proteins or adjuvants, although the GM-CSF fusion protein appeared to be unique in its ability to induce higher titers of anti-Id Abs in the primary response. Furthermore, the Id-IL-2 fusion protein induced high titers of IgG2a and IgG3 anti-Id Abs, whereas the Id-IL-4 and Id-GM-CSF fusion proteins did not. Despite the differences, tumor protection was comparable in all mice having significant titers of anti-Id Abs, regardless of the fusion protein used. We concluded that Id-cytokine fusion proteins are potent immunogens that can elicit significant antitumor immunity. The general approach of fusing a cytokine to a potential Ag may be applicable to the design of vaccines for immunotherapy of other types of tumors as well as for other pathogens and disease states.",1994
s123605,antigenic specificity of porcine t cell response against foot-and-mouth disease virus structural proteins: identification of t helper epitopes in vp1.,"antigenic specificity of porcine t cell response against foot-and-mouth disease virus structural proteins: identification of t helper epitopes in vp1.. The contribution of each of the viral capsid proteins of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) in the T cell response of vaccinated pigs has been studied. Viral polypeptides, VP1 to VP4, were expressed as fusion proteins in Escherichia coli, and were used to stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cells of vaccinated animals. Significant, dose-dependent responses to whole virion were detected in the seven animals analyzed and, in five of them, responses to recombinant polypeptides VP1, VP2, and VP3 were noticed, VP4 was recognized only by one of the pigs. Among the responder animals, VP1 and VP3 induced the higher proliferative responses. The patterns of recognition of a nested set of VP3 fragments expressed as fusions in E. coli were different among the animals studied and were consistent with the presence of different T cell epitopes on the protein. Likewise, three of the four VP1 fragments induced significant responses and were differentially recognized by each of the animals tested. Partially overlapping synthetic peptides spanning VP1 amino acids 41 to 209 were used to identify T cell epitopes in this protein. The significant responses obtained in three of seven additional FMDV vaccinated outbred pigs analyzed revealed the existence of at least 11 different T cell epitopes distributed throughout the sequence studied, which were distinctly recognized by each of the responder animals. A peptide corresponding to a relevant B cell antigenic site, around amino acids 140-160, was shown to stimulate lymphocytes from two of the responder animals. Thus, the results obtained indicate that different T cell epitopes of capsid proteins VP1 and VP3 are recognized by pig populations. The different patterns of recognition of recombinant polypeptides and synthetic peptides observed among outbred animals support an important contribution of genetic restriction, probably mediated by MHC genes, to the individual T cell response in swine.",1994
s123666,characterization of poliovirus replicons encoding carcinoembryonic antigen.,"characterization of poliovirus replicons encoding carcinoembryonic antigen.. Recombinant vaccines hold great promise for the prevention and therapy of infections diseases and cancer. We have explored the use of poliovirus as a recombinant vector to deliver genes into cells for the purpose of vaccination. For our studies, we have chosen to express the gene-encoding carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) using a novel poliovirus vector. We have constructed a recombinant CEA-poliovirus replicon in which the CEA gene was substituted for the poliovirus capsid gene. Following in vitro transcription, the RNA was transfected into cells to demonstrate CEA expression. We found that a genome in which the region encoding the signal sequence of the CEA protein (amino acids 1-34) was removed was replication competent (i.e., referred to as a replicon). We encapsidated the CEA-poliovirus replicon by transfecting this RNA into cells previously infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus (VV-P1) which expresses the poliovirus capsid protein (P1). Serial passage in the presence of VV-P1 resulted in the generation of stocks of these encapsidated replicons. Infection of cells with the encapsidated replicon containing the CEA-poliovirus genome resulted in expression of the CEA protein. To test immunogenicity, mice susceptible to poliovirus were given three doses of the encapsidated replicons via the i.m. route. By the third administration, a CEA-specific antibody response was detected. Potential future use of the poliovirus replicon system as both a parenteral and oral vaccine vector is discussed.",1994

Genetic fusions have been constructed between the highly immunogenic but atoxic fragment C of tetanus toxin and a guest peptide, aa115-131, from the protective 28-kDa glutathione S-transferase Ag of Schistosoma mansoni. Fusions have been assembled to express one, two, four, and eight tandem copies of the peptide. The recombinant vectors have been electroporated into the nonvirulent aroA strain of Salmonella typhimurium SL3261. The fusion proteins are soluble and stably expressed in Salmonella as evaluated by Western blotting with fragment C and glutathione S-transferase antisera. Mice have been immunized i.v. with a single dose of the live recombinant salmonellae. The strains are stable in mice and elicit Ab responses directed against fragment C, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Ab responses were also detected against the guest peptide.

Mutations in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Shigella spp. result in attenuation of the bacteria in both in vitro and in vivo models of virulence, although the precise block in pathogenesis is not known. We isolated defined mutations in two genes, galU and rfe, which directly affect synthesis of the LPS of S. flexneri 2a, in order to determine more precisely the step in virulence at which LPS mutants are blocked. The galU and rfe mutants invaded HeLa cells but failed to generate the membrane protrusions (fireworks) characteristic of intracellular motility displayed by wild-type shigellae. Furthermore, the galU mutant was unable to form plaques on a confluent monolayer of eucaryotic cells and the rfe mutant generated only tiny plaques. These observations indicated that the mutants were blocked in their ability to spread from cell to cell. Western immunoblot analysis of expression of IcsA, the protein essential for intracellular motility and intercellular spread, demonstrated that both mutants synthesized IcsA, although they secreted less of the protein to the extracellular medium than did the wild-type parent. More strikingly, the LPS mutants showed aberrant surface localization of IcsA. Unlike the unipolar localization of IcsA seen in the wild-type parent, the galU mutant expressed the protein in a circumferential fashion. The rfe mutant had an intermediate phenotype in that it displayed some localization of IcsA at one pole while also showing diffuse localization around the bacterium. Given the known structures of the LPS of wild-type S. flexneri 2a, the rfe mutant, and the galU mutant, we hypothesize that the core and O-antigen components of LPS are critical elements in the correct unipolar localization of IcsA. These observations indicate a more precise role for LPS in Shigella pathogenesis.",1995
s123902,use of a gene-targeted phage display random epitope library to map an antigenic determinant on the bluetongue virus outer capsid protein vp5.,"use of a gene-targeted phage display random epitope library to map an antigenic determinant on the bluetongue virus outer capsid protein vp5.. We describe the use of a gene-targeted random epitope library for the mapping of antigenic determinants. A DNA clone encoding the target antigen was digested randomly with DNase I to generate a population of DNA fragments of different sizes and sequences. After size fractionation, small DNA fragments (100-200 bp) were isolated and cloned into the phage expression vector fUSE2 to form an expression library displaying random polypeptide sequences as fusion proteins at the N terminus of the phage gene III protein. This library, termed a gene-targeted random epitope library to distinguish it from totally random synthetic epitope libraries, was then screened by affinity selection for recombinant phages which were specifically bound by the antibody of interest. Using this approach, we have mapped a monoclonal antibody (mAb)-defined epitope on the bluetongue virus outer capsid protein VP5. This epitope is not accessible on the intact virus surface, but is recognised by the immune system of sheep and cattle during virus infection. Although the example given here utilised a DNA fragment of known sequence and the library was screened for a mAb-defined epitope, the strategy described should be equally applicable to genes of unknown sequence and for screening of epitopes using polyclonal antibodies. The approach can also be extended to identify immunodominant epitope from much more complex genome-targeted random epitope library for virus, bacteria and eukaryotic organisms. Other applications of recombinant phages expressing defined immunodominant epitopes include serodiagnosis and vaccine development.",1995
s123954,production of vibrio cholerae ghosts (vcg) by expression of a cloned phage lysis gene: potential for vaccine development.,production of vibrio cholerae ghosts (vcg) by expression of a cloned phage lysis gene: potential for vaccine development.. The protein E-specific lysis mechanism of the Escherichia coli-specific bacteriophage PhiX174 was employed to produce Vibrio cholerae ghosts (VCG). VCG consist of both rounded and collapsed cells that have lost their cytoplasmic contents through an E-specific hole in the cell envelope. These ghosts are proposed as non-living material for immunization against cholera. A specific membrane anchor sequence was used to insert the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) fusion protein into the cell envelope of V. cholerae. The identity of the expression products was confirmed by Western blot analysis employing an RT-specific monoclonal antibody. HIV-1 RT was chosen as a model for the purpose of evaluating heterologous gene expression in V. cholerae and the carrier potential of VCG. Intraperitoneal immunization of mice was used to evaluate the immunogenic potential of VCG. Preliminary results showed significant seroconversions to intact whole-cell vibrio antigens in mice immunized with VCG or a heat-killed whole-cell vibrio preparation.,1994
s124092,the t cell response of hla-dr transgenic mice to human myelin basic protein and other antigens in the presence and absence of human cd4.,"the t cell response of hla-dr transgenic mice to human myelin basic protein and other antigens in the presence and absence of human cd4.. Analysis of HLA class II transgenic mice has progressed in recent years from analysis of single chain HLA class II transgenes with expression of mixed mouse/human heterodimers to double transgenic mice expressing normal human heterodimers. Previous studies have used either HLA transgenic mice in which there is a species-matched interaction with CD4 or mice which lack this interaction. Since both systems are reported to generate HLA-restricted responses, the matter of the requirement for species-matched CD4 remains unclear. We have generated triple transgenic mice expressing three human transgenes, DRA, DRB, and CD4, and compared HLA-restricted responses to peptide between human-CD4+ (Hu-CD4+) and Hu-CD4- littermates. We saw no difference between Hu-CD4+ and Hu-CD4- groups, supporting the notion that for some responses at least the requirement for species-matched CD4 may not be absolute. Evidence for positive selection of mouse T cell receptors in HLA-DR transgenic mice came both from the acquisition of new, HLA-restricted responses to various peptides and from an increased frequency of T cells using the TCR V beta 4 gene segment. An important goal with respect to the analysis of function in HLA transgenic mice is the clarification of mechanisms which underpin the recognition of self-antigens in human autoimmune disease. As a first step towards 'humanized' disease models in HLA transgenic mice, we analyzed the responses of HLA-DR transgenic mice to the human MPB 139-154 peptide which has been implicated as an epitope recognized by T cells of multiple sclerosis patients. We obtained T cell responses to this epitope in transgenic mice but not in nontransgenic controls. This study suggests that HLA transgenic mice will be valuable in the analysis of HLA-restricted T cell epitopes implicated in human disease and possibly in the design of new disease models.",1995
s124159,mhc class i-restricted cytotoxic t lymphocytes to viral antigens destroy hepatocytes in mice infected with e1-deleted recombinant adenoviruses.,"mhc class i-restricted cytotoxic t lymphocytes to viral antigens destroy hepatocytes in mice infected with e1-deleted recombinant adenoviruses.. The use of E1-deleted recombinant adenoviruses in gene therapy has consistently been associated with transient gene expression and inflammation due to immune-based destruction of the infected cells. We have used murine models of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer to liver to investigate these immunologic mechanisms. Adoptive transfer experiments, as well as studies involving genetic knockout mice, confirmed the original hypothesis that cell-mediated immunity induced by E1-deleted adenovirus destroyed trans-gene-expressing hepatocytes and defined MHC class I-restricted CD8+ cytolytic lymphocytes as the primary immune effectors for hepatocyte destruction. Responses mediated by CD4+ cells per se were insufficient to mediate destruction of hepatocytes in vivo, despite the activation of virus-specific T helper cells of Th1 subsets. A better understanding of the response of the host to in vivo gene therapy is important in evaluating its usefulness in humans.",1994
s124182,immunogenic targeting of recombinant peptide vaccines to human antigen-presenting cells by chimeric anti-hla-dr and anti-surface immunoglobulin d antibody fab fragments in vitro.,"immunogenic targeting of recombinant peptide vaccines to human antigen-presenting cells by chimeric anti-hla-dr and anti-surface immunoglobulin d antibody fab fragments in vitro.. To increase the inherently weak immunogenicity of synthetic peptide vaccines, we used recombinant DNA techniques to generate chimeras between immunogenic determinants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp120 and antibody Fab fragments reactive with surface structures displayed specifically on human antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including surface immunoglobulin D (sIgD) and class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Hybridomas producing anti-human MHC class II (HLA-DR) or surface immunoglobulin D monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that recognize nonpolymorphic determinants were used to clone chimeric Fab gene fragments by employing an established procedure to generate antigen-binding Fab libraries in phagemid vector pComb3. Molecular and immunochemical analysis indicated that the expected chimeric Fab fragments expressing the HIV-1 epitopes were correctly cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and retained the binding specificity of the native (hybridoma-derived) MAb. The chimeric Fab fragments targeted the linked HIV-1-derived antigenic determinants to the surface of human APCs in vitro, as evidenced by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Furthermore, such recombinant immunotargeted HIV-1 peptide antigens demonstrated improved immunogenicity over equivalent nonimmunotargeted control antigens, as shown by their ability to stimulate interleukin-2 production by CD4+ T-helper cells from human donors exposed to HIV-1 antigens. These data suggest that immunotargeting of recombinant peptide antigens via the attached Fab fragments facilitates uptake by human APCs with subsequent access to the MHC class II processing pathway, thereby validating the immunotargeting concept for such recombinant subunit vaccines in an in vitro human system.",1995
s124192,improved immunogenicity in mice of a mammalian cell-derived recombinant hepatitis b vaccine containing pre-s1 and pre-s2 antigens as compared with conventional yeast-derived vaccines.,"improved immunogenicity in mice of a mammalian cell-derived recombinant hepatitis b vaccine containing pre-s1 and pre-s2 antigens as compared with conventional yeast-derived vaccines.. The widely used hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccines consist of the small hepatitis B surface (SHBs) protein produced in transfected yeast cells. The frequency of non-responders, especially among immunocompromised patients, has increased the demand for a more immunogenic vaccine. We evaluated the immunogenicity of recombinant HBs 20 nm particles secreted by transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, Bio-Hep-B (BioTechnology General Ltd, Israel), and compared it with yeast-derived vaccines. The CHO-derived vaccine contains the small hepatitis B surface antigen (SHBs protein) as the major component, as well as the middle HBs (MHBs, pre-S2) and the large HBs (LHBs, pre-S1) antigens. Nine groups of ten female Balb/c mice, 4-6 weeks old, were injected once intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 0.09, 0.27 or 0.81 micrograms of each of three vaccines: Bio-Hep-B or two conventional yeast-derived recombinant vaccines, Engerix-B (SmithKline Beecham, Belgium) and H-B-Vax II (Merck, Sharp & Dohme, USA) containing only non-glycosylated SHBs antigen. After 30 days, 40% of the mice injected with 0.09 microgram Bio-Hep-B had seroconverted, but none of the mice receiving the same dose of the other vaccines. The immunogenic dose in 50% of the mice at day 14 after injection was 0.13 microgram for Bio-Hep-B, but over 0.81 microgram for the other two vaccines. Mice of the strain B10/M (which are unresponsive to SHBs and MHBs antigens at the T-cell level) developed 100-fold higher anti-HBs titres after immunization with 1 microgram of Bio-Hep-B i.p., as compared with mice receiving the same amount of yeast-derived HBsAg vaccines.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1994
s124291,antibody response elicited by t-dependent and t-independent antigens in gene targeted kappa-deficient mice.,"antibody response elicited by t-dependent and t-independent antigens in gene targeted kappa-deficient mice.. Animal models substantially contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of various human diseases, including those associated with genetic defects. Our study investigated the characteristics of antibody responses elicited by T-dependent and T-independent antigens in mice rendered kappa-deficient by targeted deletion of the J kappa C kappa gene segments. It is known that in normal murine species the kappa repertoire dominates the antibody repertoire (kappa/lambda ratio = 95:5). Our results indicate that the kappa gene deletion causes the alternative usage of lambda 1 (93%) and lambda 2 (7%) light chains, confirming previous studies demonstrating that in kappa-deficient mice all B cells express Ig lambda receptors. The anti-trinitrophenylbenzene (TNP) response in K-/- mice was compensated for by lambda 1 and lambda 2 bearing Igs. However, isoelectric focusing analysis of anti-TNP antibodies showed a considerably more restricted pattern of lambda anti-TNP antibodies in K-/- as compared with kappa antibodies in normal mice. No major differences were observed in the affinity for the hapten of kappa or lambda 1 or lambda 2 mAbs obtained from 129/Sv and K-/- mice. Furthermore, lambda 1 and lambda 2 chains can reconstitute the expression of an idiotype (460Id) borne on kappa anti-TNP antibodies. The 460Id was detected both in polyclonal and monoclonal anti-TNP antibodies obtained from K-/- mice. Our results clearly showed that the kappa anti-TNP repertoire is compensated by the lambda repertoire even though the latter is clonally restricted in K-/- mice.",1994
s124698,phagocyte-induced antigen-specific activation of unprimed cd8+ t cells in vitro.,"phagocyte-induced antigen-specific activation of unprimed cd8+ t cells in vitro.. The strict segregation of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II loading pathways has been challenged by recent reports indicating that MHC class I molecules can acquire antigen in the phagocytic pathway. We now show that this alternative peptide loading pathway can be used efficiently to generate macrophages able to activate unprimed antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells in vitro. Short peptides (8-11 residues), administered in the phagocytic pathway at nanomolar concentrations, were found to be effective in specifically activating naive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in vitro, but longer peptides or whole protein antigen were not. Whole protein antigen coated on beads did, however, render macrophages susceptible to lysis by an antigen-specific CTL clone. This indicates that proteolysis in the phagocytic pathway has limited capability for class I-restricted presentation. We propose a model for class I loading in the phagocytic pathway consisting of direct trafficking of nascent MHC class I from the trans-Golgi network to the phagosome, prior to appearance at the cell surface, and the use of the narrow cavity between bead and phagosomal membrane as a peptide exchange/loading compartment. Targeting immunogenic class I-binding peptide to the phagocytic pathway of macrophages facilitates presentation in association with class I. This is a useful tool for CTL response induction in vitro.",1995
s124787,inhibition of antigen processing by the internal repeat region of the epstein-barr virus nuclear antigen-1.,"inhibition of antigen processing by the internal repeat region of the epstein-barr virus nuclear antigen-1.. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded nuclear antigen (EBNA1) is expressed in latently EBV-infected B lymphocytes that persist for life in healthy virus carriers, and is the only viral protein regularly detected in all malignancies associated with EBV. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted, EBNA1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses have not been demonstrated. Using recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding chimaeric proteins containing an immunodominant human leukocyte antigen A11-restricted CTL epitope, amino acids 416-424 of the EBNA4 protein, inserted within the intact EBNA1, or within an EBNA1 deletion mutant devoid of the internal Gly-Ala repetitive sequence, we demonstrate that the Gly-Ala repeats generate a cis-acting inhibitory signal that interferes with antigen processing and MHC class I-restricted presentation. Insertion of the Gly-Ala repeats downstream of the 416-424 epitope inhibited CTL recognition of a chimaeric EBNA4 protein. The results highlight a previously unknown mechanism of viral escape from CTL surveillance, and support the view that the resistance of cells expressing EBNA1 to rejection mediated by CTL is a critical requirement for EBV persistence and pathogenesis.",1995
s124824,minimal epitopes expressed in a recombinant polyepitope protein are processed and presented to cd8+ cytotoxic t cells: implications for vaccine design.,"minimal epitopes expressed in a recombinant polyepitope protein are processed and presented to cd8+ cytotoxic t cells: implications for vaccine design.. The epitopes recognized by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are generated from cytosolic proteins by proteolytic processing. The nature of the influences exerted by the sequences flanking CTL epitopes on these processing events remains controversial. Here we show that each epitope within an artificial polyepitope protein containing nine minimal CD8+ CTL epitopes in sequence was processed and presented to appropriate CTL clones. Natural flanking sequences were thus not required to direct class I proteolytic processing. In addition, unnatural flanking sequences containing other CTL epitopes did not interfere with processing. The ability of every CTL epitope to be effectively processed from a protein containing only CTL epitopes is likely to find application in the construction of recombinant polyepitope CTL vaccines.",1995
s124867,quantitative correlation between hla class i allele expression and recognition of melanoma cells by antigen-specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes.,"quantitative correlation between hla class i allele expression and recognition of melanoma cells by antigen-specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes.. MHC class I antigen expression is necessary for CD8+ T-cell-mediated recognition of tumors. Recently, several mechanisms leading to loss or decreased expression of MHC antigens on the tumor cell surface have been described that may account for tumor escape from immune recognition. It is yet unknown whether tumor recognition by CTL occurs at a threshold amount of MHC molecules or correlates with the level of HLA-allele expression. In this study, a model was developed in which clones derived from the 624-MEL melanoma cell line and expressing varying amounts of HLA-A2 molecules were lysed in a standard 51Cr release assay by an HLA-A2-restricted CTL clone (A42) or a bulk culture of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. The A42 clone and the tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte culture were characterized previously as specifically recognizing the melanoma antigen MART-1(27-35) peptide. A marked heterogeneity in the susceptibility to lysis by A42 was observed in tumor clones and was not due to heterogeneous expression of MART-1 by the clones or loss of accessory molecules involved in the lymphocyte-target interaction. Lysis by A42 and by the tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte culture significantly correlated with the level of HLA-A2 expression, evaluated as mean channel number of fluorescence by flow cytometry (P < 0.001). Transfection of an HLA-A2-negative clone (624.28) with the HLA-A2.1 gene produced a panel of clones expressing different levels of HLA-A2, the lysis of which was highly correlated with the expression of HLA-A2 (P < 0.001). The addition of exogenous MART-1(27-35) peptide enhanced lysis of clones expressing intermediate amounts of HLA-A2 but did not affect clones with high expression. These data suggest that the number of HLA molecules present on the surface of tumor cells can quantitatively affect their lysis by CTL in situations with borderline amounts of peptide and/or MHC.",1995

Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocytes evade host immunity by expression of a cell-surface variant antigen and receptors for adherence to endothelial cells. These properties have been ascribed to P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), an antigenically diverse malarial protein of 200-350 kDa on the surface of parasitized erythrocytes (PEs). We describe the cloning of two related PfEMP1 genes from the Malayan Camp (MC) parasite strain. Antibodies generated against recombinant protein fragments of the genes were specific for MC strain PfEMP1 protein. These antibodies reacted only with the surface of MC strain PEs and blocked adherence of these cells to CD36 but without effect on adherence to thrombospondin. Multiple forms of the PfEMP1 gene are apparent in MC parasites. The molecular basis for antigenic variation in malaria and adherence of infected erythrocytes to host cells can now be pursued.",1995

Peptides, proteins, and more recently particulate protein antigens have been used for this purpose. The hepatitis B core antigen represents a highly immunogenic antigen in humans as well as in experimental animal models. Studies in mice have provided insight into this enhanced immunogenicity. For example, HBcAg directly activates B cells (i.e., T cell independence), HBcAg elicits strong T cell responses, and HBcAg is efficiently processed and presented by antigen presenting cells (APCs). These characteristics suggested that HBcAg may be an ideal carrier moiety for B cell epitopes requiring additional Th cell function. Therefore, a number of HBV and non-HBV B cell epitopes have been chemically linked or fused by recombinant methods to HBcAg as a method to increase immunogenicity with significant success. We have designed bacterial expression vectors that allow insertion of heterologous B cell epitopes at various positions within HBcAg particles and permit efficient purification of hybrid HBcAg particles. Studies of positional effects have demonstrated that an internal insertion into a dominant HBcAg-specific B cell site represents a superior location for enhanced antibody production. Immunogenicity studies have been extended to protection against experimental challenge in several systems. For example, a malaria CS repeat sequence derived from P. berghei was inserted into HBcAg at the internal site, and purified hybrid HBcAg/CS particles were highly immunogenic and protected 100% of experimentally challenged BALB/c mice. This system has also been exploited for purposes of oral vaccination by expressing genes coding for hybrid HBcAg particles in live, avirulent vaccine strains of Salmonella species.",1995
s124982,admixture of a recombinant vaccinia virus containing the gene for the costimulatory molecule b7 and a recombinant vaccinia virus containing a tumor-associated antigen gene results in enhanced specific t-cell responses and antitumor immunity.,"admixture of a recombinant vaccinia virus containing the gene for the costimulatory molecule b7 and a recombinant vaccinia virus containing a tumor-associated antigen gene results in enhanced specific t-cell responses and antitumor immunity.. At least two signals are required for the activation of naive T cells by antigen-bearing target cells: an antigen-specific signal, delivered through the T-cell receptor, and a costimulatory signal delivered through the T-cell surface molecule CD28 by its natural ligand B7-1. The immunological benefit of coexpression of B7 with target antigen has been demonstrated with the use of several retroviral systems to transfect antigen-bearing cells. Although engineering recombinant constructs with genes for two or more antigens can mediate the dual expression of those antigens, disadvantages of this approach include the time for construction of each desirable combination and the inability to control differential expression levels of each gene product. An alternative approach would utilize separate constructs that could be admixed appropriately before administration. In this report we describe the functional consequences of the admixture of recombinant vaccinia murine B7-1 (rV-B7) to recombinant vaccinia expressing the human carcinoembryonic antigen gene (rV-CEA). Coinfection of cells resulted in high levels of cell surface expression of both the CEA and B7 molecules. Immunization of mice with various ratios (1:3, 1:1, 3:1) of rV-CEA and rV-B7 demonstrated that an admixture of rV-CEA and rV-B7 at a 3:1 ratio resulted in the generation of optimal CEA-specific T-cell responses. Next, we examined the efficacy of this admixture on antitumor activity. Typically, injection of murine carcinoma cells expressing CEA leads to the death of the host. One immunization of C57BL/6 mice with rV-CEA:rV-B7 (3:1) resulted in no tumor establishment. In contrast, administration of rV-CEA or rV-B7 alone had little or no antitumor effects. These studies demonstrate the advantages of the use of recombinant vaccinia viruses to deliver B7 molecules in combination with a tumor-associated antigen. The availability of the rV-B7 single construct and the ability to alter the B7 ratio could also have potential utility when coinfecting rV-B7 with recombinant vaccinia viruses containing genes for infectious agents or other tumor-associated antigen genes.",1995
s125003,design of four-helix bundle protein as a candidate for hiv vaccine.,"design of four-helix bundle protein as a candidate for hiv vaccine.. To be efficient, a synthetic vaccine should contain different T and B cell epitopes of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigens, and the B epitope regions in the vaccine and in the HIV should be conformationally similar. We have suggested previously the construction of vaccines in the form of a protein with a predetermined tertiary structure, namely a four-alpha-helix bundle. Antigenic determinants of cellular and humoral immunity are blocks for the vaccine design. From experimentally studied HIV-1 T and B cell epitopes, we constructed a sequence of a four-helix protein TBI (T and B cell epitopes containing immunogen). The gene of the protein was synthesized and the protein was produced in C600 Escherichia coli cells under recA promoter from Proteus mirabelis. CD spectroscopy of the protein demonstrated that 30% of amino acid residues adopt an alpha-helical conformation. Mice immunized with TBI have shown both humoral and cellular immune responses to HIV-1. The obtained data show that the design of TBI was successful. The synthesized gene structure makes possible further reconstruction and improvement of the protein vaccine structure.",1995
s125008,induction of a cellular immune response to a defined t-cell epitope as an insert in the flagellin of a live vaccine strain of salmonella.,"induction of a cellular immune response to a defined t-cell epitope as an insert in the flagellin of a live vaccine strain of salmonella.. Attenuated strains of Salmonella have been used as vaccines to deliver heterologous antigens mainly to generate a humoral immune response. However, little is known about their ability to induce a cell-mediated immune response to the T-cell epitopes of another infectious agent or how optimally to deliver these epitopes to the host immune system. In order to study this question, a well defined MHC class II-restricted epitope (residues 88-103) from moth cytochrome C (MCC) was inserted into the central hypervariable domain of the flagellin of an attenuated strain of Salmonella dublin. The resulting flagellin was exported to the bacterial surface and polymerized into flagellar filaments that contained multiple copies of the MCC epitope. When flanked by Lys-Lys cathepsin B cleavage sites to facilitate its proteolytic release within the endosomal compartment of antigen-presenting cells, the MCC-chimeric flagellin epitope was efficiently processed in vitro by mouse peritoneal macrophages and presented to 2B4 T-hybridoma cells (specific for the MCC epitope 88-103). Stable expression of the epitope and a higher immune response was obtained in H-2k mice by integrating the chimeric flagellin gene into the chromosome of the vaccine strain. Bacteria with MCC-chimeric flagellins that were expressed from a stable chromosomal locus and flanked by cathepsin B cleavage sites were cleared more rapidly from the livers and spleens of transgenic mice with T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha and beta chains specific for the MCC epitope than were bacteria lacking the epitope. Antigen processing and presentation of class II-restricted epitopes expressed as chimeric proteins by attenuated bacterial vaccine vectors may be facilitated by the presence of endosomal protease cleavage sites on each side of the epitope and by chromosomal integration of the coding sequence.",1995
s125086,a vaccine conjugate of 'iscar' immunocarrier and peptide epitopes of the e7 cervical cancer-associated protein of human papillomavirus type 16 elicits specific th1- and th2-type responses in immunized mice in the absence of oil-based adjuvants.,"a vaccine conjugate of 'iscar' immunocarrier and peptide epitopes of the e7 cervical cancer-associated protein of human papillomavirus type 16 elicits specific th1- and th2-type responses in immunized mice in the absence of oil-based adjuvants.. TraT protein, known as ISCAR (= Immunostimulatory Carrier), is one of a family of integral membrane proteins (Imps) of Escherichia coli representing powerful carrier molecules which when injected into experimental animals generate substantial antibody and T proliferative responses to molecules conjugated to it. We extend these findings to show that ISCAR functions to stimulate Th1- and Th2-type responses, including specific cytotoxic T cells and tumour protection. We report here that by conjugating to ISCAR a 19mer peptide containing linear B epitopes, a T helper (Th) epitope, and a H-2b-restricted T cytotoxic (CTL) epitope of E7 protein of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16), and immunizing C57B1/6 (H-2b) mice, we elicited (i) specific IgG2a and IgG1 antibodies; (ii) IL-2 and IL-4 production by specifically recalled lymph node cells in vitro; (iii) cytotoxic T lymphocytes which specifically killed both E7 peptide-pulsed, and whole E7 gene-transfected tumour target cells; and (iv) in vivo protection against an E7 gene-transfected tumour cell inoculum. These findings have implications for the design of vaccines to stimulate immune responses to endogenously processed target antigens (e.g. tumour-associated antigens) without the unwanted side effects of oil-based adjuvants. In addition they support the case for a E7-targeted therapeutic vaccine for HPV-associated human cervical cancer.",1995
s125102,a new family of genes coding for an antigen recognized by autologous cytolytic t lymphocytes on a human melanoma.,"a new family of genes coding for an antigen recognized by autologous cytolytic t lymphocytes on a human melanoma.. Human melanoma MZ2-MEL expresses several distinct antigens that are recognized by autologous cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL). Some of these antigens are encoded by genes MAGE-1, MAGE-3, and BAGE, which are expressed in a large fraction of tumors of various histological types but are silent in normal adult tissues with the exception of testis. We report here the identification of the gene coding for MZ2-F, another antigen recognized by autologous CTL on MZ2-MEL cells. This gene, which was named GAGE-1, is not related to any presently known gene. It belongs to a family of genes that are expressed in a variety of tumors but not in normal tissues, except for the testis. Antigenic peptide YRPRPRRY, which is encoded by GAGE-1, is recognized by anti-MZ2-F CTL on class I molecule HLA-Cw6. The two genes of the GAGE family that code for this peptide, namely GAGE-1 and GAGE-2, are expressed in a significant proportion of melanomas (24%), sarcomas (25%), non-small cell lung cancers (19%), head and neck tumors (19%), and bladder tumors (12%). About 50% of melanoma patients carry on their tumor at least one of the presently defined antigens encoded by the MAGE, BAGE, and GAGE genes.",1995

The potential utility of Shigella flexneri aroD vaccine candidates for the development of bi- or multivalent vaccines has been explored by the introduction of the genetic determinants rfp and rfb for heterologous O antigen polysaccharide from Shigella dysenteriae serotype 1. The serotype Y vaccine strain SFL124 expressed the heterologous antigen qualitatively and quantitatively well, qualitatively in the sense of the O antigen polysaccharide being correctly linked to the S. flexneri lipopolysaccharide R3 core oligosaccharide and quantitatively in the sense that typical yields were obtained, with ratios of homologous to heterologous O antigen being 4:1 for one construct and 1:1 for another. Moreover, both polysaccharide chains were shown to be linked to position O-4 of the subterminal D-glucose residue of the R3 core. In contrast to the hybrid serotype Y SFL124 derivatives, analogous derivatives of serotype 2a vaccine strain SFL1070 did not elaborate a complete heterologous O antigen. Such derivatives, and analogous derivatives of rough, O antigen-negative mutants of SFL1070, formed instead a hybrid lipopolysaccharide molecule consisting of the S. flexneri lipid A R3 core with a single repeat unit of the S. dysenteriae type 1 O antigen. Introduction of the determinants for the S. dysenteriae type 1 O antigen into a second serotype 2a strain and into strains representing other serotypes of S. flexneri, revealed the following for the expression of the heterologous O antigen: serotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, and 5a did not produce the heterologous O antigen, whereas serotypes 2b, 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b, 5b, and X did.",1995

Transgenic plants that express foreign proteins with industrial or pharmaceutical value represent an economical alternative to fermentation-based production systems. Specific vaccines have been produced in plants as a result of the transient or stable expression of foreign genes. It has recently been shown that genes encoding antigens of bacterial and viral pathogens can be expressed in plants in a form in which they retain native immunogenic properties. Transgenic potato tubers expressing a bacterial antigen stimulated humoral and mucosal immune responses when they were provided as food. These results provide 'proof of concept' for the use of plants as a vehicle to produce vaccines.,1995

Over the past 15 years, advances in molecular biology have permitted in vitro and in vivo gene transfer into mammalian cells. Genetically engineered microorganisms are highly promising developments for gene therapy and the future of vaccines. Such vectors constitute genuine tools for high level expression of heterologous genes for both therapeutic and induced immunity applications. Several vector systems have emerged with different relative advantages and limits depending on the proposed application.

We have cloned and expressed the gp63 gene of Leishmania major in BCG to develop a recombinant vaccine against zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis. Two different expression systems were investigated. The first system consists of pAN, a Mycobacterium paratuberculosis promoter, which drives expression of ORF2, an open reading frame in IS900. This system allows the production of heterologous polypeptides as hybrids with the ORF2 gene product. The second expression system relies on the production of antigenic fragments as fusion proteins with the N-terminal region of Mycobacterium fortuitum beta-lactamase. Both constructs resulted in the production of Gp63 in BCG. The ability of the two recombinant BCG strains to induce protective immunity against a challenge with L. major amastigotes was evaluated after vaccination of susceptible (BALB/c), and resistant (C57BL/6) mice. Recombinant BCG producing Gp63 as a hybrid protein with the N-terminal region of the beta-lactamase elicited significant protection against a challenge with L. major in BALB/c-immunized mice.",1995

The polymer has also succeeded in dramatically increasing the amount of ELISA antibodies to TT. The antibody response elicited was predominantly of the IgG1 isotype. PCPP has also been used to generate micron-sized hydrogel microspheres through a process of divalent ion cross-linking of the polymer strands. These microspheres can induce significantly higher anti-TT serum IgG titers after a single intranasal immunization than TT alone.",1995

They are fully researched up to the stage of specific commercial application. Inulin itself is registered for human use as a solution and is without physiological effect except for ACP activation as gamma-IN particles. The ACP comprises a relatively harmless part of the inflammatory response. Gamma inulin is nontoxic in several species including humans and is nonpyrogenic. The amount of systemic C3a produced from adjuvant-active doses of gamma-IN is expected to be very much less than that routinely tolerated without effect by human renal dialysis patients. Registration of gamma-IN should not be difficult. Gamma inulin in vivo is either dissolved and excreted unchanged or metabolized to simple foodstuffs. Its primary chemical structure is completely known, and it is inexpensive, readily available, and easy to handle and manufacture. It is completely stable under normal conditions of use and storage. Patent cover is either fully granted or accepted for granting in most developed countries. Alum is also registered for human use and its combination with gamma-IN known as Algammulin is equally nontoxic especially in the fine formulation, and is equally stable. The partial coating with inulin in Algammulin greatly reduces the undesirable effects of alum such as granuloma formation and IgE generation. Combinations of gamma-IN with immunogen carriers other than alum are feasible, either as hybrid particles or as simple mixtures of particles of similar size. Gamma inulin, and especially Algammulin, are potent enhancers of the Th1 immune response pathway, boosting seroconversion rates and immunological memory in protective Ab classes and enhancing cell-mediated immunity. The responses can equal those of CFA. They are also Th2 pathway enhancers, especially for IgA, and the emphasis on Th2 might be varied by altering the alum-to-inulin ratio in the final formulation. A dual response (balanced Th1 and Th2) may be desirable for several reasons. Their primary targets in vivo are probably lymphocytes rather than macrophages. Gamma inulin-based adjuvants therefore comprise new, safe, potent, and attractive candidates for enhancing responses to human and veterinary vaccines, especially those requiring cell-mediated defenses.",1995

The use of nucleic acid-based vaccines is a novel approach to immunization that elicits immune responses similar to those induced by live, attenuated vaccines. Administration of nucleic acid vaccines results in the endogenous generation of viral proteins with native conformation, glycosylation profiles, and other posttranslational modifications that mimic antigen produced during natural viral infection. Nucleic acid vaccines have been shown to elicit both antibody and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses to diverse protein antigens. Advantages of nucleic acid-based vaccines include the simplicity of the vector, the ease of delivery, the duration of expression, and, to date, the lack of evidence of integration. Further studies are needed to assess the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of this new and promising technology.",1995
s125556,bacterial pyrogenic exotoxins as superantigens.,"bacterial pyrogenic exotoxins as superantigens.. The recent discovery of the mode of interaction between a group of microbial proteins known as superantigens and the immune system has opened a wide area of investigation into the possible role of these molecules in human diseases. Superantigens produced by certain viruses and bacteria, including Mycoplasma species, are either secreted or membrane-bound proteins. A unique feature of these proteins is that they can interact simultaneously with distinct receptors on different types of cells, resulting in enhanced cell-cell interaction and triggering a series of biochemical reactions that can lead to excessive cell proliferation and the release of inflammatory cytokines. However, although superantigens share many features, they can have very different biological effects that are potentiated by host genetic and environmental factors. This review focuses on a group of secreted pyrogenic toxins that belong to the superantigen family and highlights some of their structural-functional features and their roles in diseases such as toxic shock and autoimmunity. Deciphering the biological activities of the various superantigens and understanding their role in the pathogenesis of microbial infections and their sequelae will enable us to devise means by which we can intervene with their activity and/or manipulate them to our advantage.",1995

BACKGROUND & AIMS: The genes MAGE-1 and MAGE-3 both encode melanoma peptide antigens recognized by major histocompatibility complex-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The antigens may be a target for immunotherapy. There is, however, little information on the expression of these genes in gastric carcinomas. Therefore, the expression of MAGE genes in gastric carcinomas was evaluated. METHODS: The expression of MAGE-1, MAGE-2, and MAGE-3 genes in tumors and corresponding normal tissue specimens was studied using a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The results were analyzed according to clinicopathologic factors of the tumor. RESULTS: In the 68 gastric carcinomas studied, MAGE-1, MAGE-2, and MAGE-3 messenger RNA were detected in 41%, 31%, and 38%, respectively. Fifty percent of the gastric carcinomas expressed at least one of the MAGE genes. Messenger RNA for the three MAGE proteins was not detected in normal gastric tissue. MAGE gene expression in gastric carcinomas was not associated with a significant clincopathology of the tumor. However, gene expression was lower in mucinous carcinomas (3 of 10). CONCLUSIONS: MAGE-1, MAGE-2, and MAGE-3 are expressed in a high percentage of gastric carcinomas. These tumor rejection antigens may provide tumor-specific targets for immunotherapy.",1995
s125803,the effects of changes at peptide residues contacting mhc class ii t-cell receptor on antigen recognition and human th0 cell effector function.,"the effects of changes at peptide residues contacting mhc class ii t-cell receptor on antigen recognition and human th0 cell effector function.. Cytokines can influence the selection of functional subsets (Th1 or Th2) of CD4+ T cells. However, quantitative changes in affinity of peptide/major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II/T-cell receptor (TCR) interactions may alter antigen density and modulate T-cell effector function. The possibility exists to use peptide analogues to induce a partial signal to dissociate production of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) by T-helper type-0 (Th0) cells and, consequently, to regulate T-cell function. Based on binding assays and resolution of the crystalline structure of an influenza virus haemagglutinin peptide (HA 306-318) bound to the human MHC class II molecule DRB1*0101, we synthesized HA peptide analogues with amino acid substitutions predicted to modify either MHC class II/peptide density or TCR/peptide interactions. When we examined their antigenicity using cloned human Th0 cells, the analogues, in general, elicited a gradation in potency reflected by a reduction in both proliferation and cytokine production (IL-2, IL-4 and IFN-gamma). Although the analogue HA-R309 diminished IL-2 production, none of the analogues tested could selectively induce only IL-4 or IFN-gamma. Since, in general, the effector functions of the Th0 cells examined here were resistant to selective manipulation by the peptide analogues, this suggests that for some clones of chronically activated T cells modulation of selected functions may be difficult to achieve.",1995
s125810,molecular and biochemical characterization of a coccidioides immitis-specific antigen.,"molecular and biochemical characterization of a coccidioides immitis-specific antigen.. Results of earlier investigations have indicated that the saprobic phase of Coccidioides immitis produces a heat-stable, 19-kDa antigen with serine proteinase activity which has been suggested to be specific for this pathogenic fungus. In the present study we have determined the N-terminal and partial internal amino acid sequences of the purified, 19-kDa antigen, cloned the gene which encodes this polypeptide, and confirmed that the secreted proteinase is a Coccidioides-specific antigen (CS-Ag). Both the genomic and cDNA sequences are reported and reveal that the csa gene which encodes this antigen has no introns. A 543-bp open reading frame encodes a 181-amino-acid-containing protein with a predicted molecular mass of 19.8 kDa and an isoelectric point of 8.3. The csa gene was localized on chromosome I of three representative C. immitis clinical isolates on the basis of Southern hybridizations. Expression of the csa gene in Escherichia coli using the pET21a plasmid vector yielded a recombinant protein that was recognized in immunoblot assays by antibody raised to the purified 19-kDa CS-Ag. Secretion of the native antigen is suggested to occur by cleavage of a putative 23-residue signal peptide. The native CS-Ag showed a low degree of glycosylation. Analysis of the carbohydrate composition of the CS-Ag revealed xylose, mannose, galactose, and glucose. However, the purified antigen showed no affinity for concanavalin A. A PCR method with specificity and high sensitivity for detection of C. immitis genomic DNA, using a pair of synthetic oligonucleotide primers whose sequences were based on that of the csa gene, was developed. A 520-bp product was amplified only when C. immitis genomic DNA was used as the template. The lower limits of DNA detection using this PCR method were 1 pg of C. immitis genomic DNA by ethidium bromide staining and 100 fg after Southern hybridization. The csa gene-based PCR method for detection of C. immitis DNA is useful for culture identification and may have clinical applications for the diagnosis of coccidioidal infections.",1995

To identify and purify molecules present in culture medium filtrate which are dominant antigens during effective vaccination, a two-step selection procedure was used to select antigens able to interact with T lymphocytes and/or antibodies induced by immunization with living bacteria and to counterselect antigens interacting with the immune effectors induced by immunization with dead bacteria. A Mycobacterium bovis BCG 45/47-kDa antigen complex, present in BCG culture filtrate, has been previously identified and isolated (F. Romain, A. Laqueyrerie, P. Militzer, P. Pescher, P. Chavarot, M. Lagranderie, G. Auregan, M. Gheorghiu, and G. Marchal, Infect. Immun. 61:742-750, 1993). Since the cognate antibodies recognize the very same antigens present in M. tuberculosis culture medium filtrates, a project was undertaken to clone, express, and sequence the corresponding gene of M. tuberculosis. An M. tuberculosis shuttle cosmid library was transferred in Mycobacterium smegmatis and screened with a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect the clones expressing the proteins. A clone containing a 40-kb DNA insert was selected, and by means of subcloning in Escherichia coli, a 2-kb fragment that coded for the molecules was identified. An open reading frame in the 2,061-nucleotide sequence codes for a secreted protein with a consensus signal peptide of 39 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of 28,779 Da. The gene was referred to as apa because of the high percentages of proline (21.7%) and alanine (19%) in the purified protein. Southern hybridization analysis of digested total genomic DNA from M. tuberculosis (reference strains H37Rv and H37Ra) indicated that the apa gene was present as a single copy on the genome. The N-terminal identity or homology of the M. tuberculosis and M. bovis BCG purified molecules and their similar global and deduced amino acid compositions demonstrated the perfect correspondence between the molecular and chemical analyses. The presence of a high percentage of proline (21.7%) was confirmed and explained the apparent higher molecular mass (45/47 kDa) determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis resulting from the increased rigidity of molecules due to proline residues.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1995
s125815,"prevalence and association of the longus pilus structural gene (lnga) with colonization factor antigens, enterotoxin types, and serotypes of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli.","prevalence and association of the longus pilus structural gene (lnga) with colonization factor antigens, enterotoxin types, and serotypes of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli.. Human enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) produces a plasmid-encoded type IV pilus termed longus (for long pilus). Regardless of the geographic origins of ETEC strains, the longus structural gene lngA was found to have the highest level of association with ETEC producing colonization factor antigen (CFA) CFA/II, followed by ETEC producing CFA/I and CFA/IV. ETEC bearing the less prevalent CFA/III and putative colonization factors and ETEC negative for CFA and putative colonization factor also contained lngA-related sequences. lngA was found in a considerable number of ETEC serotypes and was more often associated with ETEC producing heat-stable enterotoxins than with ETEC producing both heat-labile and heat-stable enterotoxins or heat-labile enterotoxin alone. lngA was found more often in strains isolated from children with diarrhea than in strains from healthy children, suggesting an association with intestinal disease. We conclude that longus is a widely distributed antigenic determinant in ETEC that is highly associated with known plasmid-encoded virulence factors, namely, CFAs and enterotoxins. A longus-specific probe may be a helpful epidemiological tool to assist in the identification of ETEC.",1995
s125974,rate of antigen degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway influences mhc class i presentation.,"rate of antigen degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway influences mhc class i presentation.. The effect on MHC class I Ag presentation of enhancing a protein's rate of degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway was investigated. In extracts of mouse B-lymphoblasts and reticulocytes, as in rabbit reticulocytes, proteins with acidic or basic N-termini are conjugated to ubiquitin and degraded by the 26S proteasome very rapidly. We found that the rate of MHC class I presentation of microinjected beta-galactosidase was enhanced when this antigenic protein was modified with such a destabilizing amino-terminal residue. This enhanced presentation was inhibited by blocking potential ubiquitination sites on the protein through methylation of amino groups and by peptide aldehyde inhibitors of the proteasome. Furthermore, in B lymphoblast cell extracts, the rapid degradation of these beta-galactosidase constructs required ATP and ubiquitin and was blocked by inhibitors of proteasomes. Their rates of degradation in extracts correlated with their rates of class I Ag presentation in vivo. These results indicate that ubiquitin conjugation is a key rate-limiting step in Ag presentation and provide further evidence for a critical role of ubiquitin and the 26S proteasome in generating MHC class I-presented peptides.",1995
s125988,peptide binding to mhc class i molecules: implications for antigenic peptide prediction.,"peptide binding to mhc class i molecules: implications for antigenic peptide prediction.. The human mayor histocompatibility complex class I molecule HLA-A2 preferentially binds peptides that contain Leu at P2 and Val or Leu at the C terminus. The other amino acids in the peptide also contribute to binding positively or negatively. It is possible to estimate the binding stability of HLA-A2 complexes containing particular peptides by applying coefficients, deduced from a large amount of binding data, that quantify the relative contribution of each amino acid at each position. In this review, we describe the molecular basis for these coefficients and demonstrate that estimates of binding stability based on the coefficients are generally concordant with experimental measurements of binding affinities. Peptides that contained cysteine were predicted less well, possibly because of complications resulting from peptide dimerization and oxidation. Apparently, peptide binding affinity is largely controlled by the rate of dissociation of the HLA/peptide/beta 2-microglobulin complex, whereas the rate of formation of the complex has less impact on peptide affinity. Although peptides that bind tightly to HLA-A2, including many antigenic peptides bind much more weakly. Therefore, a full understanding of why certain peptides are immunodominant will require further research.",1995
s125999,properties of modified hepatitis b virus surface antigen particles carrying pres epitopes.,"properties of modified hepatitis b virus surface antigen particles carrying pres epitopes.. The current hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccines contain the small (S) and middle (M) viral envelope proteins in particulate form but lack the large (L) protein. Although these particles elicit protective immunity to HBV, inclusion of the immunogenic preS1 region of the L protein may enhance their efficacy. To present preS1-derived epitopes on secretable subviral particles we rearranged the HBV envelope ORF by fusing part or all of the preS1 region to either the N or C terminus of the S protein. Fusion of the first 42 residues of preS1 to either site allowed efficient secretion of the modified particles and rendered the linked sequence accessible at the surface of the particle. Conversely, fusion of preS1 sequences to the C terminus of the M protein completely blocked secretion. This block to secretion could be rescued by provision of a heterologous N-terminal signal sequence. All these particles displayed preS1, preS2 and S protein antigenicity. In mice, each construct elicited high titres of preS1-specific antibodies which recognized the authentic L protein. Particles composed of the modified M protein also induced a preS2-specific response. Unexpectedly, however, neither particle elicited S protein-specific antibodies. Nonetheless, the genetic approach employed here represents a strategy to incorporate preS1-derived epitopes both in high density and in highly immunogenic form into their authentic carrier matrix.",1995
s126071,the phop locus influences processing and presentation of salmonella typhimurium antigens by activated macrophages.,"the phop locus influences processing and presentation of salmonella typhimurium antigens by activated macrophages.. The destruction and processing of bacteria by activated macrophages facilitates the presentation of antigens to T cells and thereby promotes the induction of specific immunity. The PhoP-PhoQ regulatory system that controls the synthesis of many Salmonella proteins required for virulence and survival within macrophages is one mechanism that this particular intracellular pathogen has evolved to resist destruction. To address whether the phoP locus also influences antigen processing during the interaction of Salmonella typhimurium with macrophages, we tested the effect of phoP mutations on the processing and presentation of model antigens expressed by the bacteria. Activated macrophages processed phoP- bacteria with greater efficiency than wild-type bacteria, as measured by the response of antigen-specific T-hybridoma cells; Salmonella constitutively expressing PhoP were processed even less efficiently than wild-type Salmonella. After heat-inactivation, however, both wild-type and phoP- bacteria were efficiently processed. The altered processing and presentation efficiency was not due to differences in the level of antigen expressed by the bacteria or differences in the level of bacterial uptake by the macrophages. In addition, phoP-regulated gene expression was shown to influence processing of antigen phagocytosed independently of the bacteria. Thus, phoP-regulated gene products decrease the processing and presentation of S. typhimurium antigens, demonstrating a role for this virulence locus in the inhibition of the induction of specific immunity.",1995
s126327,virus-vectored immunocontraception for control of wild rabbits: identification of target antigens and construction of recombinant viruses.,"virus-vectored immunocontraception for control of wild rabbits: identification of target antigens and construction of recombinant viruses.. The need to control animal populations arises in many situations in the world from a variety of motives. Present control strategies are almost universally based on lethal procedures. Increasingly, there is dissatisfaction with such approaches from many different perspectives. In response to these concerns, the concept of controlling populations of pest species through control of their fertility has been mooted. Successful examples of this approach exist in cases of small, discrete pest populations but application of this to a widely distributed species over a broad geographical area has not yet been achieved. In this article, we report on a new approach to fertility control, virus-vectored immunocontraception, and discuss its applicability to control of wild rabbit populations. Particular emphasis is placed on the strategy for selection of a target molecule capable of inducing an immunocontraceptive response and on how the gene encoding such a molecule might be engineered into the myxoma virus for distribution into the population. The fact that the procedures for antigen identification and the viral engineering methods used are, to varying extents, generic means that the broad principles of this approach are applicable in other species.",1994
s126331,studies of the anaerobically induced promoter pnirb and the improved expression of bacterial antigens.,"studies of the anaerobically induced promoter pnirb and the improved expression of bacterial antigens.. The promoter of the Escherichia coli gene nirB is induced by both the presence of nitrite in the environment and by low oxygen tensions. It has been used to direct the high-level expression of heterologous proteins by E. coli strains in fermentors, and attenuated Salmonella strains expressing foreign proteins under nirB promoter (pnir) control have efficiently induced an immune response against these proteins. The genes encoding two different E. coli envelope proteins, the outer membrane protein LamB and the periplasmic protein MalE, were placed under pnir control on pBR322 derivatives, and both proteins were expressed at high levels during anaerobic growth. Our results showed that the expression level of MalE was influenced by the distance between the pnir promoter and the Shine-Dalgarno sequence: the highest levels were obtained by the longest constructs made; pnir directed a 4-fold increase in the level of MalE expression relative to the level reached by the previously described ptac-MalE expression vector. The best pnir construct produced 25 mg of MalE protein per 5 x 10(11) bacteria, which represents over 20% of total cell protein. Overexpression of MalE was well tolerated by E. coli, even under strict anaerobic conditions; for LamB, optimal induction was achieved under partial anaerobiosis. A MalE-HIV1 hybrid protein (33 residues from the V3 loop of HIV1 gp160 inserted into site 133 of MalE) was also overexpressed at a similar yield under pnir control, without apparent degradation of the hybrid protein. Moreover, when expressed in attenuated aroA S. typhimurium strain SL3261, the plasmids carrying malE and malE-HIV genes were stable in vitro and in vivo.",1995
s126332,expression and immunogenicity of an 18-residue epitope of hiv1 gp41 inserted in the flagellar protein of a salmonella live vaccine.,"expression and immunogenicity of an 18-residue epitope of hiv1 gp41 inserted in the flagellar protein of a salmonella live vaccine.. A synthetic oligonucleotide specifying residues 735-752 of the product of the env gene of HIV1 IIIB was inserted by blunt-end ligation at restriction sites in the hypervariable, antigenically determinant region IV of two flagellin genes. Its integration, in frame and correct orientation, into gene fliC(d) in plasmid pLS408 allowed production of functional flagella when the plasmid was placed in a flagellin-negative aroA live-vaccine Salmonella dublin strain, SL5928. Bacteria thus made motile were immobilized and agglutinated by anti-(735-752 peptide) serum; expression was also shown by immunoelectron-microscopy and by Western blot of whole-cell lysates. Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) of sera of mice given three doses by intraperitoneal injection of the live-vaccine strain producing chimeric flagellin, or of concentrated flagella from it, showed production of antibody with affinity for the peptide, and in some sera, also for r-gp160. Pooled serum from mice given five i.p. doses of the live vaccine strain expressing the gp41 epitope at the surface of its flagellar filaments had higher titres of anti-peptide and anti-r-gp160 antibody and weak neutralizing activity on the IIIB isolate (90% neutralization at 1/100). The sera of nine mice given two doses of the live vaccine by the oral route had either no or only very low titres of antibody to flagellar antigen d; they were therefore not tested for anti-peptide activity.",1995
s126672,transcriptional regulatory sequences of carcinoembryonic antigen: identification and use with cytosine deaminase for tumor-specific gene therapy.,"transcriptional regulatory sequences of carcinoembryonic antigen: identification and use with cytosine deaminase for tumor-specific gene therapy.. The 5' sequences from the human carcinoembryonic antigen gene (CEA) were analyzed using luciferase reporter gene assays. This analysis identified important cis-acting sequences needed for selective expression in CEA-positive cells. Over 50 CEA/luciferase reporter clones were constructed and analyzed in two CEA-positive and two CEA-negative cell lines. The CEA sequences analyzed extended from the translational start to 14.5 kb 5' of the CEA gene. A 408-bp region from the CEA 3' untranslated region was also examined for its effect on reporter gene activity. The CEA promoter was located between bases -90 and +69 of the transcriptional start site. Sequences between -41 and -18 were essential for expression from the CEA promoter. Multimerization of sequences between -89 and -40 resulted in copy number-related increases in both expression level and selectivity for CEA-positive cells. Two upstream regions of CEA, -13.6 to -10.7 kb or -6.1 to -4.0 kb, when linked to the multimerized promoter led to high-level, selective expression in CEA-positive cell lines. Several CEA/luciferase constructs demonstrated 80- to 120-fold higher expression in CEA-positive cell lines compared to expression in CEA-negative Hep3B cells. The expression from these constructs was quite strong in CEA-positive cells, being two- to four-fold higher than an SV40 enhancer/promoter construct. The most promising CEA transcriptional regulatory sequences were used to regulate the expression of cytosine deaminase (CD) in stable cell lines. The expression of CD was assessed directly by an enzymatic assay and indirectly by determining the in vitro IC50 to 5-fluorocytosine (5FC). The chimeric gene pCEA/CD-145 displayed the desired expression spectrum--high-level expression in the CEA-positive cells and low-level expression in CEA-negative cells. CD expression from this chimera correlated well with the expression of the endogenous CEA gene. Treatment of mice bearing NCI H508 pCEA/CD-145 tumor xenografts with 5FC lead to significant antitumor effects in vivo. The CEA/CD chimeric gene should be useful for tumor-specific suicide gene therapy of CEA-positive tumors.",1995
s126801,genetic detoxification of bacterial toxins: a new approach to vaccine development.,"genetic detoxification of bacterial toxins: a new approach to vaccine development.. Chemically detoxified bacterial toxins (toxoids) have been successfully used as vaccines for the prevention of many bacterial infectious diseases. Today, nontoxic derivatives of bacterial toxins can be obtained by mutagenesis of the toxin genes. These genetically inactivated toxins are superior to the classical toxoids both in safety and in immunogenicity and therefore they should replace the old toxoids in the existing vaccines. In addition, they represent a novel class of immunogens with unique properties, some of which may be used for innovative approaches to vaccination.",1995
s126808,hiv-1 soluble antigens induced cd8+ cytotoxic t-cell responses in an immunized individual.,"hiv-1 soluble antigens induced cd8+ cytotoxic t-cell responses in an immunized individual.. In an attempt to determine whether immunization of healthy HIV-1 seronegative individuals with a soluble gp160 candidate vaccine could induce an anti-HIV specific immune response, volunteers were immunized by two injections of a water-in-oil emulsion containing a mixture of gp160 antigen together with selected peptides. Following immunization, lymphocytes were collected and stimulated in vitro with autologous HIV-1-infected cells. The results showed that immunization with soluble HIV-1 envelope was able to generate CD3+ CD8+ CTLs directed to gp160 antigen. The CTL response was restricted to class I molecule HLA-A2. The CTL response was comparable to that elicited by immunization with HIV-1-envelope recombinant vaccinia virus.",1995
s126936,lmp2+ proteasomes are required for the presentation of specific antigens to cytotoxic t lymphocytes.,"lmp2+ proteasomes are required for the presentation of specific antigens to cytotoxic t lymphocytes.. BACKGROUND: Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules present short peptides generated by intracellular protein degradation to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). The multisubunit, non-lysosomal proteinases known as proteasomes have been implicated in the generation of these peptides. Two interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-inducible proteasome subunits, LMP2 and LMP7, are encoded within the MHC gene cluster in a region associated with antigen presentation. The incorporation of these LMP subunits into proteasomes may alter their activity so as to favour the generation of peptides able to bind to MHC class I molecules. It has been difficult, however, to demonstrate a specific requirement for LMP2 or LMP7 in the presentation of peptide epitopes to CTL. RESULTS: We describe a T-cell lymphoma, termed SP3, that displays a novel selective defect in MHC class I-restricted presentation of influenza virus antigens. Of the MHC-encoded genes implicated in the class I pathway, only LMP2 is underexpressed in SP3 cells. Expression of IFN-gamma in transfected SP3 cells simultaneously restores LMP2 expression and antigen presentation to CTL. Expression of antisense-LMP2 mRNA in these IFN-gamma-transfected cells selectively represses antigen recognition and the induction of surface class I MHC expression. Moreover, the expression of this antisense-LMP2 mRNA in L929 fibroblast cells, which constitutively express LMP2 and have no presentation defect, blocks the presentation of the same influenza virus antigens that SP3 cells are defective in presenting. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the LMP2 proteasome subunit can directly influence both MHC class I-restricted antigen presentation and class I surface expression.",1995
s127128,targeting antigen into the phagocytic pathway in vivo induces protective tumour immunity.,"targeting antigen into the phagocytic pathway in vivo induces protective tumour immunity.. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) kill neoplastic or virally infected cells after recognizing on their surface antigenic peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. These peptides are derived from antigens that are degraded in the cytosol of the affected cell. Because exogenous proteins cannot enter the cytosol, immunizations with killed pathogens or their proteins do not generally elicit CTLs. However, antigens that are internalized into phagocytic cells can enter the cytosol and be processed for class I presentation. Here we show that immunization with a purified antigen on an avidly phagocytized particle primes CTLs, which in turn protect animals from subsequent challenge with tumours transfected with the antigen gene. Interestingly, these animals also become immune to other antigens expressed by the tumour. This approach could be exploited to develop tumour and viral vaccines.",1995
s127181,generation of antimelanoma cytotoxic t lymphocytes from healthy donors after presentation of melanoma-associated antigen-derived epitopes by dendritic cells in vitro.,"generation of antimelanoma cytotoxic t lymphocytes from healthy donors after presentation of melanoma-associated antigen-derived epitopes by dendritic cells in vitro.. MHC class I-restricted CTLs specific for antigens expressed by malignant cells are an important component of immune responses against human cancer. Recently, in melanoma a number of melanocyte differentiation antigens have been identified as potential tumor rejection antigens. In the present study, we show that by applying peptide-loaded dendritic cells, induced by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin 4 from peripheral blood monocytes of healthy donors, we were able to elicit melanoma-associated antigen-specific CTL in vitro. We demonstrate the induction of CTLs directed against HLA-A2.1 presented epitopes derived from tyrosinase, gp100, and Melan A/MART-1. Apart from lysis of peptide-loaded target cells, these CTLs displayed reactivity with HLA-A2.1+ melanoma tumor cell lines and cultured normal melanocytes endogenously expressing the target antigen. These data indicate that these CTLs recognize naturally processed and presented epitopes and that precursor CTLs against melanocyte differentiation antigens are present in healthy individuals. The ability to generate tumor-specific CTLs in vitro, using granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor/interleukin 4-induced dendritic cells, illustrates the potential use of this type of antigen-presenting cells for vaccination protocols in human cancer.",1995
s127333,listeriolysin generates a route for the presentation of exogenous antigens by major histocompatibility complex class i.,"listeriolysin generates a route for the presentation of exogenous antigens by major histocompatibility complex class i.. We have exploited the pore forming activity of listeriolysin, the hemolysin of Listeria monocytogenes, to activate CD8+ T cells with soluble proteins in vivo and in vitro. Immunization with soluble, hemolytically active listeriolysin induces both cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells, and the CD8+ T cells can be propagated with soluble listeriolysin in vitro. Moreover, conventional antigens like ovalbumin mixed together with listeriolysin are also efficiently introduced into the MHC class I pathway in vitro and in vivo. Hence, listeriolysin effectively directs itself and passenger molecules into the intracellular compartment that leads to the cytotoxic T cell response. In this way, we circumvent the bias of CD8+ T cells to recognize intracellular antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. As cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are of pivotal importance in eliminating viral and microbial pathogens, the findings reported here could prove to be useful in vaccine development.",1995
s127461,idiotypic dna vaccines against b-cell lymphoma.,"idiotypic dna vaccines against b-cell lymphoma.. Idiotypic antigens are clearly defined tumor-associated protein antigens, which can induce protective immunity against lymphoma. Because each patient requires an individual vaccine, idiotypic antigens also provide ideal candidates for exploring the feasibility of replacing protein antigens by DNA vaccines. Component idiotypic variable region genes can be identified in patients' tumor biopsies and rapidly assembled as scFv sequences. These can be used to produce recombinant scFv protein in bacteria, or as direct naked DNA vaccines. A preliminary small trial of DNA vaccines for chemotherapy-resistant patients with lymphoma has begun. Intramuscular idiotypic DNA vaccination in a mouse model induces low levels of anti-idiotypic antibody in serum. Levels can be increased dramatically by coinjection of DNA plasmids encoding either IL-2 or GM-CSF, and specific proliferative anti-idiotypic T cells are induced. However protective immunity remains to be demonstrated, and a possible reason for this may lie in the continued secretion of idiotypic scFv antigen which blocks antibody activity by formation of immune complexes. Methods for regulating secretion of antigen are required before this category of tumor antigen can be fully exploited as a vaccine. The power of DNA technology should allow analysis and manipulation of pathways of antigen presentation to induce maximal therapeutic attack on neoplastic B cells. In addition, lymphoma presents a model for application of DNA technology to the wide range of human tumors known to harbor potential tumor antigens.",1995
s127494,immune responses to novel escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium vectors that express colonization factor antigen i (cfa/i) of enterotoxigenic e. coli in the absence of the cfa/i positive regulator cfar.,"immune responses to novel escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium vectors that express colonization factor antigen i (cfa/i) of enterotoxigenic e. coli in the absence of the cfa/i positive regulator cfar.. An asd-stabilized plasmid carrying enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli cfaABCE genes was constructed and called pJGX15C-asd+. Expression of colonization factor antigen I (CFA/I) by this plasmid occurs independently of the cfaABCE positive regulator cfaR in attenuated Salmonella delta aro delta asd strain H683 and nonpathogenic laboratory E. coli asd strain chi 6212. Oral immunization of mice with nonpathogenic E. coli chi 6212 (pJGX15C-asd+) does not elicit significant serum or mucosal responses against CFA/I. In contrast, oral immunization with a single dose of attenuated S. typhimurium H683(pJGX15C-asd+) elicits a 10(5)-fold increase in CFA/I-specific serum immunoglobulin G and significant elevation of CFA/I-specific immunoglobulin A-secreting B cells in the lamina propria, mesenteric lymph nodes, and spleen. Thus, only the Salmonella-CFA/I construct effectively delivered CFA/I to the inductive sites of the gut-associated and systemic lymphoid tissues.",1995
s127747,identification of an hla-a11-restricted epitope from the tandem repeat domain of the epithelial tumor antigen mucin.,"identification of an hla-a11-restricted epitope from the tandem repeat domain of the epithelial tumor antigen mucin.. Epithelial cell mucin encoded by the MUC-1 gene is overexpressed and aberrantly glycosylated on pancreatic, breast, and ovarian cancers as well as on multiple myelomas. It is recognized by patients' Ab and by T cells derived from tumor-draining lymph nodes. The T cell recognition is not MHC restricted and is specific for an epitope previously localized to the immunodominant tandem repeat region of the native mucin molecule. In search of possible MHC-restricted epitopes in the same immunodominant region, we synthesized a panel of overlapping, nine-amino acid long peptides spanning the MUC-1 tandem repeat and first examined their binding to specific human MHC class I molecules using two independent flow cytometry-based assay systems. This approach identified one peptide, p9-17 (STAPPAHGV), that bound to HLA-A1, -A2.1, -A3, and -A11. Measurements of the affinity of binding to each of these alleles, using a quantitative molecular binding assay, indicated that only the relative binding affinity to HLA-A11 was close to immunogenic values. We tested the immunogenicity of p9-17 in vitro. We detected a secondary T cell response specific for p9-17 in lymph nodes from an HLA-A11 breast cancer patient. Moreover, CTL specific for p9-17 peptide could be generated from PBL in several healthy HLA-A11 donors by primary in vitro stimulation.",1995
s127748,induction of cell-mediated immune responses to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gag protein by using listeria monocytogenes as a live vaccine vector.,"induction of cell-mediated immune responses to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gag protein by using listeria monocytogenes as a live vaccine vector.. Cytolytic T cells, acting through cytokines or by direct lysis of infected target cells, have been shown to play a significant role in the control of viral infections and may be responsible for the prolonged asymptomatic phase following infection by HIV. Accordingly, methods that can generate strong cell-mediated immune responses may be useful in the development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines against HIV. Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive intracellular microorganism that elicits strong cell-mediated immune responses against its own secreted proteins following infection. In this study we have modified the chromosome of L. monocytogenes so that it stably expresses and secretes the p55 HIV gag gene product and examined the cell-mediated immune response of BALB/c mice to infection with this recombinant organism. Infected animals were found to mount a specific, strong, long-lasting CD8+ cytolytic T cell response against a predominant epitope contained within the p24 fragment of the HIV Gag protein. This epitope previously has been shown to be recognized by CTLs obtained from some HIV-infected humans. Our results suggest that chromosomally modified strains of L. monocytogenes may provide valuable vaccine vectors for use against HIV.",1995
s127757,human dendritic langerhans cells generated in vitro from cd34+ progenitors can prime naive cd4+ t cells and process soluble antigen.,"human dendritic langerhans cells generated in vitro from cd34+ progenitors can prime naive cd4+ t cells and process soluble antigen.. Earlier studies have concluded that fresh Langerhans cells (LC) are able to capture and process native Ags, whereas cultured LC have lost these functions while acquiring the capacity to prime naive T cells. Herein we studied the functions of human dendritic/Langerhans cells (d-Lc) generated in vitro by culturing CD34+ hemopoietic progenitor cells in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) + TNF-alpha. Less than 50 d-Lc were found to strongly stimulate the proliferation of 2.5 x 10(4) allogeneic naive CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, six to 50 d-Lc induced half-maximal proliferation of naive syngeneic CD4+ cord blood T cells, in the presence of picomolar concentrations of superantigens. During the alloreaction, the CD4+ T cells were expanded up to 100-fold within two successive stimulation cycles with the same d-Lc, and the recovered T cells were specific for the d-Lc alloantigen. HLA-matched tetanus toxoid (TT)-specific T cell clones were found to proliferate in response to TT presented by CD1a+ d-Lc. Finally, electron microscopy demonstrated that CD1a+ d-Lc were able to capture an Ag (gold-labeled Igs) through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Thus, in vitro generated d-Lc can prime naive T cells and process native Ags, a property that might eventually prove useful for priming Ag-specific naive T cells for cellular immunotherapy.",1995
s127772,human studies in the development of human immunodeficiency virus vaccines.,"human studies in the development of human immunodeficiency virus vaccines.. The safety and immunogenicity of candidate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vaccines have been studied in > 1500 healthy, seronegative (HIV-1-uninfected) subjects. HIV-1 envelope proteins, gp160 and gp120, have been the most extensively investigated. A live virus vector construct, vaccinia with insertion of the HIV-1 env gene, has also been studied. HIV-1 candidate vaccines have been well tolerated, with no acute or longer-term serious toxicity. Intramuscular multidose gp120 vaccines induce neutralizing antibodies, lymphoproliferative responses, and anti-HIV-1 CD4 cytotoxic T cell (CTL) activity. Immunization with the vaccinia-env construct, followed by a boost with an envelope protein, also induces neutralizing antibodies, and anti-HIV-1 CTL activity (CD8, major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted) has been observed. To date, serum from vaccinees can neutralize laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strains in vitro but not primary isolates; the significance of this observation is unknown. Additional approaches to vaccination against HIV-1 are in development.",1995
s127802,irradiated sporozoite vaccine induces hla-b8-restricted cytotoxic t lymphocyte responses against two overlapping epitopes of the plasmodium falciparum sporozoite surface protein 2.,"irradiated sporozoite vaccine induces hla-b8-restricted cytotoxic t lymphocyte responses against two overlapping epitopes of the plasmodium falciparum sporozoite surface protein 2.. Vaccines designed to protect against malaria by inducing CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in individuals of diverse HLA backgrounds must contain multiple conserved epitopes from various preerythrocytic-stage antigens. Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite surface protein 2 (PfSSP2) is considered an important antigen for inclusion in such vaccines, because CD8+ CTL against the P. yoelii SSP2 protect mice against malaria by eliminating infected hepatocytes. To develop PfSSP2 as a component of malaria vaccines, we investigated the presence of anti-PfSSP2 CTL in two HLA-B8+ volunteers immunized with irradiated P. falciparum sporozoites and characterized their CTL responses using PfSSP2-derived 15-amino acid peptides bearing the HLA-B8-binding motif. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from both volunteers stimulated with recombinant vaccinia expressing PfSSP2 displayed antigen-specific, genetically restricted, CD8+ T cell-dependent CTL activity against autologous target cells expressing PfSSP2. Of the five HLA-B8 motif-bearing 15-mers identified in the PfSSP2 sequence, two peptides sharing a 10-amino acid overlap sensitized HLA-B8-matched target cells from both volunteers for lysis by peptide-stimulated effectors. The CTL activity was HLA-B8 restricted and dependent on CD8+ T cells. Analysis of the three shorter peptides representing HLA-B8 motif-bearing sequences within the two positive peptides for their ability to bind to HLA-B8 in vitro, and to sensitize target cells for lysis by effectors stimulated with the 15-mers, identified two overlapping HLA-B8-restricted CTL epitopes. Available data indicate that the sequence of one CTL epitope is conserved and the other is variant among P. falciparum isolates. Circulating activated CTL against the conserved epitope could be directly identified in one of the two volunteers. The identification of two HLA-B8-restricted CTL epitopes on PfSSP2 provides data critical to developing an epitope-based anti-liver stage malaria vaccine.",1995

The safety and the immunogenicity of a recombinant canarypox live vector expressing the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp160 gene from the MN isolate, ALVAC-HIV (vCP125), followed by booster injections of a soluble recombinant hybrid envelope glycoprotein MN/LAI (rgp160), were evaluated in vaccinia-immune, healthy adults at low risk for acquiring HIV-1 infection. Volunteers (n = 20) received vCP125 (10(6) TCID50) at 0 and 1 month, followed randomly by rgp160 formulated in alum or in Freund's incomplete adjuvant (FIA) at 3 and 6 months. Local and systemic reactions were mild or moderate and resolved within the first 72 hr after immunization. No significant biological changes in routine tests were observed in any volunteer. Two injections of vCP125 did not elicit antibodies. Neutralizing antibodies (NA) against the HIV-1 MN isolate were detected in 65 and 90% of the subjects after the first and the second rgp 160 booster injections, respectively. Six months after the last boost, only 55% were still positive. Seven of 14 sera with the highest NA titers against MN weakly cross-neutralized the HIV-1 SF2 isolate; none had NA against the HIV-1 LAI or against a North American primary isolate. Specific lymphocyte T cell proliferation to rgp 160 was detected in 25% of the subjects after vCP125 and in all subjects after the first booster injection and 12 months after the first injection. An envelope-specific cytotoxic lymphocyte activity was found in 39% of the volunteers and characterized for some of them as CD3+, CD8+, MHC class I restricted. The adjuvant formulation did not influence significantly the immune responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1995
s128154,peripheral deletion of antigen-reactive t cells in oral tolerance.,"peripheral deletion of antigen-reactive t cells in oral tolerance.. Oral administration of antigen is used to induce antigen-specific peripheral immune tolerance. As well as preventing systemic immune responses to ingested proteins, oral tolerance to autoantigens has also been used to suppress autoimmune diseases in animals and humans. Both active suppression and clonal anergy are suggested to be mechanisms of oral tolerance, depending on the dose of antigen fed. Here we report that oral antigen can delete antigen-reactive T cells in Peyer's patches, in mice transgenic for the ovalbumin-specific T-cell receptor genes. The deletion was mediated by apoptosis, and was dependent on dosage and frequency of feeding. At lower doses deletion was not observed; instead there was induction of antigen-specific cells that produced transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 cytokines. At higher doses, both Th1 and Th2 cells were deleted following their initial activation, whereas cells which secrete TGF-beta were resistant to deletion. These findings demonstrate that orally administered antigen can induce tolerance not only by active suppression and clonal anergy but by extrathymic deletion of antigen-reactive Th1 and Th2 cells.",1995
s128441,selection of a single amino acid substitution in the hemagglutinin molecule by chicken eggs can render influenza a virus (h3) candidate vaccine ineffective.,"selection of a single amino acid substitution in the hemagglutinin molecule by chicken eggs can render influenza a virus (h3) candidate vaccine ineffective.. This study investigated whether a single amino acid change in the hemagglutinin (HA) molecule influenced the efficacy of formalin-inactivated influenza A (H3N1) vaccine candidates derived from high-growth reassortants between the standard donor of high-yield genes (A/PR/8/34 [H1N1]) and host cell variants generated from the same clinical isolate (A/Memphis/7/90 [H3N2]) by passage in embryonated chicken eggs. Two clones of the isolate generated by growth in eggs differed from the parent virus (represented by an MDCK cell-grown counterpart) solely by the presence of Lys (instead of Glu) at position 156 or Ile (instead of Ser) at position 186 in the HA1 subunit. The protective efficacy of egg-grown HA Lys-156 and HA Ile-186 reassortant variants was compared with that of the MDCK cell-grown reassortant vaccine. Classically, antibody titers in serum have been used to demonstrate vaccine efficacy. Here, parameters of B-cell responsiveness were monitored, including the kinetics, character, and localization of the primary antibody-forming cell (AFC) response and the development of B-cell memory in lymphoid tissues associated with the priming site (spleen) and responsive to pulmonary challenge with infectious virus (upper and lower respiratory tract lymph nodes). We show that the egg-grown HA Lys-156 variant induced an AFC profile vastly different from that elicited by the other two reassortant vaccines. The vaccine was poorly immunogenic; it induced antibodies that were cross-reactive prior to challenge but which, postchallenge with a lethal dose of the MDCK cell-grown reassortant virus, were targeted primarily to the HA Lys-156 variant, were of the immunoglobulin M isotype, were nonprotective, and were derived from the spleen. In contrast, the egg-grown HA Ile-186 variant was remarkably like the MDCK cell-grown virus in that protective immunoglobulin G antibodies were unaffected by the Ile-186 substitution but poorly recognized HA with Lys-156. Furthermore, memory AFC responsiveness was localized to regional lymphoid tissue in the upper respiratory tract, where challenge HA was found. Thus, it is recommended that in the selection of vaccine candidates, virus populations with the egg-adapted HA Lys-156 substitution be eliminated and that, instead, egg-grown isolates which minimally contain Ile-186 be used as logical alternatives to MDCK cell-grown viruses.",1995

Recombinant polioviruses expressing antigens from rotavirus, herpes simplex virus type 2, and hepatitis B virus were generated. Fusion of the heterologous polypeptides to the amino terminus of the poliovirus polyprotein did not prevent myristylation of VP0, suggesting a novel mechanism of myristylation for these recombinant viruses. The effects of the parental genetic background, different foreign sequences, and different insert sizes on growth characteristics were compared. Both the size and the nature of the heterologous sequence appeared to be factors influencing the growth and stability of recombinant polioviruses. All of the recombinants showed a temperature-sensitive phenotype, regardless of the genetic background (attenuated or wild type) from which they were derived. Preliminary studies with transgenic mice carrying the poliovirus receptor gene are discussed.",1995
s128453,construction of intertypic chimeric dengue viruses exhibiting type 3 antigenicity and neurovirulence for mice.,"construction of intertypic chimeric dengue viruses exhibiting type 3 antigenicity and neurovirulence for mice.. There are four dengue virus serotypes (DEN1 to -4), each of which causes major epidemics in tropical or subtropical areas. The current strategy for dengue virus immunization favors the use of a tetravalent vaccine preparation. We have previously employed full-length DEN4 cDNA to construct a viable intertypic dengue virus type 1 or type 2 chimera that contained the C-PreM-E or only the PreM-E genes of DEN1 or DEN2 substituting for the corresponding genes of DEN4. This success implied that it might be possible to create mutants of all four dengue virus serotypes for evaluation as candidate vaccines. In this study, we constructed DEN3-DEN4 chimeras that contained DEN3 C-PreM-E genes and expressed DEN3 antigenic specificity. Unlike our previous successes in cloning DEN1 or DEN2 chimeric cDNA, we were not able to clone the DEN3 C-PreM-E genes directly in the 5' intermediate vector or in the full-length chimeric DEN3-DEN4 plasmid in Escherichia coli. Nevertheless, a full-length DNA template of DEN3-DEN4 that could be used for transcription of infections RNAs was prepared by in vitro ligation. Progeny virus recovered from RNA-transfected C6/36 mosquito cells exhibited DEN3 antigenic specificity as determined by a reaction with monoclonal antibodies. Gel electrophoresis of virus-infected cell lysates yielded the predicted viral protein pattern, i.e., DEN3 C, PreM, and E and DEN4 nonstructural proteins. Two amino acid substitutions, Thr-435-->Leu and Glu-406-->Lys, which are analogous to mutations that, respectively, confer mouse neurovirulence on DEN4 and DEN2, were introduced into DEN3 E. A mutant chimera containing the Thr-435-->Leu substitution, which ablates the potential glycosylation site sequence, produced an E protein identical in size to that of wild-type DEN3 E, indicating that the glycosylation site is normally not used. Intracerebral inoculation of suckling mice revealed that the mutant chimera containing the Glu-406-->Lys substitution was neurovirulent, whereas its wild-type counterpart or parent DEN3 was not.",1995
s128657,"uptake of microparticle-adsorbed protein antigen by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells results in up-regulation of interleukin-1 alpha and interleukin-12 p40/p35 and triggers prolonged, efficient antigen presentation.","uptake of microparticle-adsorbed protein antigen by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells results in up-regulation of interleukin-1 alpha and interleukin-12 p40/p35 and triggers prolonged, efficient antigen presentation.. Dendritic cells synthesize and express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II peptide-binding elements constitutively and, therefore, belong to the category of professional antigen-presenting cells. Unlike other cells that show constitutive class II expression, such as B cells and certain T cell clones, dendritic cells possess the unique capacity to activate naive T cells. Using dendritic cells generated in vitro by culture of mouse bone marrow in the presence of low doses of recombinant mouse granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, we found that discrete maturation stages of these cells can be distinguished which were correlated with defined functional capabilities. The striking observation was the presence of a progenitor dendritic cell expressing low levels of class II which, unlike its differentiated counterpart in vitro, possessed pronounced phagocytic activity. Adding protein antigen to dendritic cells in a particle-adsorbed form, as compared to a soluble form, we demonstrate that phagocytosis of the particle-adsorbed protein by progenitor dendritic cells involves an activation event. This is evidenced by the de novo synthesis of transcripts of interleukin-1 alpha and interleukin-12 p40/p35 as well as transcripts of MHC class II. Most importantly, an augmented and prolonged antigen-presentation capacity was observed when the antigen was given in particle-adsorbed instead of soluble form. These findings indicate that progenitor dendritic cells are functionally more flexible and potent than fully differentiated dendritic cells and that they play a crucial role in antigen presentation. It is suggested that these findings will open up new possibilities to devise strategies for vaccine development.",1995
s128660,immunoglobulin variable gene analysis of human autoantibodies reveals antigen-driven immune response to glutamate decarboxylase in type 1 diabetes mellitus.,"immunoglobulin variable gene analysis of human autoantibodies reveals antigen-driven immune response to glutamate decarboxylase in type 1 diabetes mellitus.. Insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes mellitus is an organ-specific autoimmune disease frequently associated with an islet-specific humoral autoimmune response. The role of islet cell autoantibodies in the disease process is unclear; in particular, it is not known whether they are a non-specific side effect of islet cell destruction or play a role in the autoimmune network leading to type 1 diabetes. Here we report the immunoglobulin gene usage and somatic mutation rates of a panel of seven human monoclonal islet cell autoantibodies (MICA 1-7) directed towards the major islet cell autoantigen glutamate decarboxylase (GAD). These autoantibodies were produced from cells from two patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes. VH1, VH4 and V lambda 2 gene segments were frequently used in the MICA, but no correlation between V gene usage and epitope recognition was found. The nonrandom ratio of replacement versus silent mutations in the variable gene region, an accumulation of replacement mutations in the complementarity determining regions, which confer antigen binding, and the high relative avidity for GAD observed for MICA 1, 3, 4, and 6, suggested that the immune response to GAD is driven by the antigen. In contrast, MICA 2, 5, and 7, revealing a lower affinity for antigen, have accumulated a large number of silent mutations. These latter antibodies may, therefore, be characteristic for later stages of the chronic autoimmune disease. Our results argue in favor of an antigen-driven autoantibody response to islets in human type 1 diabetes. They suggest that GAD is an important target of autoimmunity associated with type 1 diabetes.",1995
s128923,active immunization with recombinant v antigen from yersinia pestis protects mice against plague.,"active immunization with recombinant v antigen from yersinia pestis protects mice against plague.. The gene encoding V antigen from Yersinia pestis was cloned into the plasmid expression vector pGEX-5X-2. When electroporated into Escherichia coli JM109, the recombinant expressed V antigen as a stable fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase. The glutathione S-transferase-V fusion protein was isolated from recombinant E. coli and cleaved with factor Xa to yield purified V antigen as a stable product. Recombinant V antigen was inoculated intraperitoneally into mice and shown to induce a protective immune response against a subcutaneous challenge with 3.74 x 10(6) CFU of virulent Y. pestis. Protection correlated with the induction of a high titer of serum antibodies and a T-cell response specific for recombinant V antigen. These results indicate that V antigen should be a major component of an improved vaccine for plague.",1995
s129299,generation of human cytotoxic t cells specific for human carcinoembryonic antigen epitopes from patients immunized with recombinant vaccinia-cea vaccine.,"generation of human cytotoxic t cells specific for human carcinoembryonic antigen epitopes from patients immunized with recombinant vaccinia-cea vaccine.. BACKGROUND: The human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which is expressed in several cancer types, is a potential target for specific immunotherapy using recombinant vaccines. Previous studies have shown that when the CEA gene is placed into vaccinia virus, the recombinant vaccine (rV-CEA) can elicit T-cell responses in both rodents and non-human primates. PURPOSE: Our objective was to determine if rVCEA could elicit CEA-specific T-cell responses in humans with appropriate human leukocyte antigen (HLA) motifs. METHODS: Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) obtained from patients with metastatic carcinoma, both before and after vaccination with rV-CEA, were analyzed for T-cell response to specific 9- to 11-mer CEA peptides selected to conform to human HLA class I-A2 motifs. RESULTS: While little or no T-cell growth was seen from preimmunization PBLs of patients pulsed with CEA peptides and interleukin 2 (IL-2), T-cell lines were obtained from PBLs of patients after vaccination with one to three cycles of stimulation. Cytolytic T-cell lines from three HLA-A2 patients were established with a 9-amino acid peptide (CAP-1), and the CD8+/CD4+ double-positive T-cell line (V24T) was chosen for detailed analysis. When autologous Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B cells were either incubated with CAP-1 peptide or transduced with the CEA gene using a retroviral vector, they were lysed by the V24T cell line, but allogeneic non-A2 EBV-transformed B cells were not. The SW403 human colon carcinoma cell line, which is CEA positive and HLA-A2 positive, was also lysed by the V24T cell line, while two non-HLA-A2 CEA-positive colon carcinoma cell lines were not. To further confirm the class I HLA-A2 restricted nature of the V24T cytotoxicity, the non-HLA-A2 SW837 CEA-expressing colon carcinoma cell line was infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the HLA class I-A2 gene, and it became susceptible to V24T lysis. Cells infected with vector alone were not lysed. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates for the first time (a) the ability to generate a human cytolytic T-cell response to specific epitopes of CEA, (b) the class I HLA-A2 restricted nature of the T-cell mediated lysis, and (c) the ability of human tumor cells to endogenously process CEA to present a specific CEA peptide in the context of major histocompatibility complex for T-cell-mediated lysis. IMPLICATIONS: These findings have implications in the development of specific second-generation cancer immunotherapy protocols.",1995
s129571,investigation of promoter function in human and animal cells infected with human recombinant adenovirus expressing rotavirus antigen vp7sc.,"investigation of promoter function in human and animal cells infected with human recombinant adenovirus expressing rotavirus antigen vp7sc.. Human adenovirus (Ad) vectors are being used increasingly for a variety of applications in vaccination and gene therapy. The ability of vectors to enter cells and the efficiency of promoters expressing the therapeutic gene or vaccine antigen are critical to the outcome of such experiments. To identify promoters which might be suitable for use under a variety of conditions we have investigated the expression of a rotavirus antigen, VP7sc, employing several commonly used promoters carried in E1-substituted Ad vectors both in cell types which support virus replication and in cells which do not. Although not all gene constructions were identical, wide variations in promoter function were evident even in human 293 cells which support virus replication. The simian virus type 40 (SV40) early and beta-actin promoters expressed poorly; the SV40 late promoter was somewhat better. The human IE94 cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and a modified Ad major late promoter were best, functioning equally well but with different kinetics. In other human cell lines the CMV promoter was more versatile, generally providing sustained expression at a significant level, in one case for at least 6 days. In addition, as mouse, rabbit and pig models of rotavirus infection are under investigation and VP7sc is a vaccine antigen, we also investigated the ability of the recombinant adenovirus to infect cells from these and other sources. VP7sc expression was detected in several heterologous cell types, illustrating the ubiquity of the human Ad receptor and the versatility of human Ad as vectors when suitable promoters are used.",1995
s129647,expression of endogenous peptide-major histocompatibility complex class ii complexes derived from invariant chain-antigen fusion proteins.,"expression of endogenous peptide-major histocompatibility complex class ii complexes derived from invariant chain-antigen fusion proteins.. CD4+ T cells recognize major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-bound peptides that are primarily obtained from extracellular sources. Endogenously synthesized proteins that readily enter the MHC class I presentation pathway are generally excluded from the MHC class II presentation pathway. We show here that endogenously synthesized ovalbumin or hen egg lysozyme can be efficiently presented as peptide-MHC class II complexes when they are expressed as fusion proteins with the invariant chain (Ii). Similar to the wild-type Ii, the Ii-antigen fusion proteins were associated intracellularly with MHC molecules. Most efficient expression of endogenous peptide-MHC complex was obtained with fusion proteins that contained the endosomal targeting signal within the N-terminal cytoplasmic Ii residues but did not require the luminal residues of Ii that are known to bind MHC molecules. These results suggest that signals within the Ii can allow endogenously synthesized proteins to efficiently enter the MHC class II presentation pathway. They also suggest a strategy for identifying unknown antigens presented by MHC class II molecules.",1995
s129650,upregulation of class i major histocompatibility complex antigens by interferon gamma is necessary for t-cell-mediated elimination of recombinant adenovirus-infected hepatocytes in vivo.,"upregulation of class i major histocompatibility complex antigens by interferon gamma is necessary for t-cell-mediated elimination of recombinant adenovirus-infected hepatocytes in vivo.. Recombinant adenoviruses are attractive vehicles for liver-directed gene therapy because of the high efficiency with which they transfer genes to hepatocytes in vivo. First generation recombinant adenoviruses deleted of E1 sequences also express recombinant and early and late viral genes, which lead to development of destructive cellular immune responses. Previous studies indicated that class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play a major role in eliminating virus-infected cells. The present studies utilize mouse models to evaluate the role of T-helper cells in the primary response to adenovirus-mediated gene transfer to the liver. In vivo ablation of CD4+ cells or interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) was sufficient to prevent the elimination of adenovirus-transduced hepatocytes, despite the induction of a measurable CTL response. Mobilization of an effective TH1 response as measured by in vitro proliferation assays was associated with substantial upregulation of MHC class I expression, an effect that was prevented in IFN-gamma-deficient animals. These results suggest that elimination of virus-infected hepatocytes in a primary exposure to recombinant adenovirus requires both induction of antigen-specific CTLs as well as sensitization of the target cell by TH1-mediated activation of MHC class I expression.",1995
s129832,deletion or alteration of hydrophobic amino acids at the first and the third transmembrane domains of hepatitis b surface antigen enhances its production in escherichia coli.,"deletion or alteration of hydrophobic amino acids at the first and the third transmembrane domains of hepatitis b surface antigen enhances its production in escherichia coli.. To investigate the failure of high-level production of hepatitis B viral (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg), including three authentic forms, large (L), middle (M) and major/small (S) HBsAg, in Escherichia coli, we employed the high-expression vector pGEX containing the glutathione S-transferase-encoding gene (GST) to study HBsAg production. Different fragments of HBV DNA containing the entire pre-S1/pre-S2/S region (for L protein), or partial pre-S1, pre-S2, pre-S1/pre-S2 and pre-S2/S region (for M protein), were fused downstream from the GST gene, in order to obtain five plasmids which encode GST-HBsAg fusion proteins. SDS-PAGE analyses revealed that cells containing plasmids with a full-length S region (pGLS and pGMS) produced undetectable GST-HBsAg fusion proteins, in contrast to those cells harboring plasmids without the S region (pGS1, pGS2 and pGS1S2), which synthesized fusion proteins in 3-10% of the total cellular protein. Using an immunoblot method to screen HBsAg production in cells which harbored plasmids derived from exonuclease BAL 31-digested pGLS, we obtained eight positive clones. Nucleotide sequence analyses of plasmids from the positive clones revealed that termination, deletion or frameshift occurred at the regions encoding either the first or the third transmembrane domain of the major HBsAg. Correlation between the production level of GST-HBsAg fusion proteins and their constituent and arrangement of amino acids (aa) at the last 20 aa among 15 clones suggested that the fusion protein ended with a longer stretch of or a higher ratio of hydrophobic aa had a lower production in E. coli.",1995
s129929,"in vitro induction of primary, antigen-specific ctl from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with synthetic peptides.","in vitro induction of primary, antigen-specific ctl from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with synthetic peptides.. A protocol for in vitro induction of primary, antigen-specific CTL from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was developed. Antigen presenting cells (APCs) consisted of Staphylococcus aureus Cowan-I (SAC-I) activated PBMCs treated with a citrate-phosphate buffer at pH 3 to release endogenous peptides bound to surface MHC. This treatment resulted in transient expression of empty class I molecules which could be subsequently stabilized with peptide and beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2m). SAC-I activated PBMCs from HLA-A2.1 normal donors loaded with HBV core 18-27 peptide following acid treatment were used to stimulate PBMCs depleted of CD4+ T cells, in the presence of recombinant interleukin-7 (rIL-7). After 12 days, cells were restimulated with autologous, peptide-pulsed, adherent cells and tested for CTL activity 7 days later. In 23 independent experiments from 13 different HLA-A2.1 donors, this protocol resulted in induction of primary CTL more than 90% of the time. As indicated by both the frequency and magnitude of the response against peptide-sensitized target cells, SAC-I activated PBMCs treated with acid were the most efficient stimulator APC. Thirteen per cent of the cultures generated were capable of lysing target cells transfected with the HBV core antigen and, in general, these CTL cultures exhibited high avidity for the HBV core peptide. This protocol is generally applicable to different antigens and class I alleles, and thus, may be utilized to screen large numbers of peptides to identify human CTL epitopes.",1995
s129969,a mutated intron sequence codes for an antigenic peptide recognized by cytolytic t lymphocytes on a human melanoma.,"a mutated intron sequence codes for an antigenic peptide recognized by cytolytic t lymphocytes on a human melanoma.. We have identified an antigen recognized on a human melanoma by autologous cytolytic T lymphocytes. It is encoded by a gene that is expressed in many normal tissues. Remarkably, the sequence coding for the antigenic peptide is located across an exon-intron junction. A point mutation is present in the intron that generates an amino acid change that is essential for the recognition of the peptide by the anti-tumor cytotoxic T lymphocytes. This observation suggests that the T-cell-mediated surveillance of the integrity of the genome may extend to some intronic regions.",1995
s129979,induction of antigen-specific cytolytic t cells in situ in human melanoma by immunization with synthetic peptide-pulsed autologous antigen presenting cells.,"induction of antigen-specific cytolytic t cells in situ in human melanoma by immunization with synthetic peptide-pulsed autologous antigen presenting cells.. Human melanoma cells can process the MAGE-1 gene product and present the processed nonapeptide EADPTGHSY on their major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, HLA-A1, as a determinant for cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Considering that autologous antigen presenting cells (APCs) pulsed with the synthetic nonapeptide might, therefore, be immunogenic, melanoma patients whose tumor cells express the MAGE-1 gene and who are HLA-A1+ were immunized with a vaccine made of cultured autologous APCs pulsed with the synthetic nonapeptide. Analyses of the nature of the in vivo host immune response to the vaccine revealed that the peptide-pulsed APCs are capable of inducing autologous melanoma-reactive and the nonapeptide-specific CTLs in situ at the immunization site and at distant metastatic disease sites.",1995
s130135,a vaccinia-gp160-based vaccine but not a gp160 protein vaccine elicits anti-gp160 cytotoxic t lymphocytes in some hiv-1 seronegative vaccinees.,"a vaccinia-gp160-based vaccine but not a gp160 protein vaccine elicits anti-gp160 cytotoxic t lymphocytes in some hiv-1 seronegative vaccinees.. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) play an important role in the immune response to viral infection by recognizing and destroying infected cells. HIV-1 elicits an unusually strong CTL response in infected individuals and clearance of the viremia of acute infection coincides with the development of HIV-specific CTL. Because HIV-specific CTL may provide protection against de novo viral infection, we compared the CTL response in seronegative volunteers treated with two vaccination approaches. Seven volunteers were immunized with a live recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the HIV envelope protein gp160LAI (HIVAC-1e) and boosted with 640 micrograms recombinant baculovirus-expressed gp160LAI in alum 1-13 months later. In a second study, three volunteers underwent four successive immunizations with 640 micrograms subunit gp160LAI in alum at 0, 1, 6, and 12 months. The first vaccination strategy using a liver vector would be expected to generate gp160-specific CTL, while for the second, using only whole-protein subunit, the generation of specific CTL would be unlikely. Predominantly CD8+ T-cell lines generated from PBMC by nonspecific stimulation with PHA and IL-2 were screened after three to four weeks of culture for cytolytic activity against autologous targets infected with vaccinia vectors encoding envLAI, RT, gag, and lacZ control. A strong gp 160-specific CTL response was detected in two vaccines in the recombinant vaccinia plus subunit boost study. Modest responses were seen in four of the other five live vector-primed vaccinees. No significant gp160-specific CTL were observed in three volunteers given only subunit rgp160 or in five control subjects.",1995
s130373,new approaches to hepatitis a and b vaccines.,"new approaches to hepatitis a and b vaccines.. Plasma-derived vaccines and yeast-derived recombinant vaccines against hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection have gained an acceptable record of efficacy. However, non- or hyporesponsiveness to immunization does not only occur in cases of obesity, renal failure or immune suppression, but also in healthy individuals. There is therefore a rationale for developing more immunogenic vaccines against HBV, especially for those populations who are potential non- or hyporesponders. Currently used recombinant hepatitis B vaccines consist of antigen particles assembled with the product of 226 amino acids encoded in the S gene. Since proteins encoded in the pre-S gene are also incorporated in the HBV envelope, pre-S gene products should, at least in theory, be useful in improving protection with hepatitis B vaccines. Inactivated hepatitis A vaccines are more potent than currently used hepatitis B vaccines. Two injections of a standard dose of HAVRIX (SB) by the intramuscular route, or even a single injection using a higher dose (HAVRIX 1440), will achieve protective levels of antibodies. Therefore, increased potency is not essential with inactivated hepatitis A vaccines. New hepatitis A vaccines are likely to be recombinant or attenuated live types. Another aspect of the improvement of existing hepatitis A and B vaccines is unification into a combined form.",1995

Mortality and morbidity data continue to indicate there is a compelling need for the derivation of a new generation of vaccine delivery systems that can be usefully applied via injection and also mucosally. One technology that has potential for design as an effective vaccine delivery system is the formulation of biodegradable microparticles from the polymers and poly lactide co-glycolide (PLGA) in particular. The potential advantages of the delivery of vaccines within such microparticles is discussed. The potential for eliciting and optimising immunity after the mucosal delivery of biodegradable microparticles is also discussed.,1995
s130469,dna vaccines: a novel approach to immunization.,"dna vaccines: a novel approach to immunization.. Direct DNA inoculations are being developed as a method of subunit vaccination. Plasmid DNAs encoding influenza virus hemagglutinin glycoproteins have been tested for the ability to provide protection against lethal influenza challenges. In immunization trials using inoculations of purified DNA in saline, 67-95% of test mice and 25-63% of test chickens were protected against the lethal challenge. Good protection was achieved by intramuscular, intravenous and intradermal injections. In mice, 95% protection was achieved by gene gun delivery of 250-2500 times less DNA than the saline inoculations. Successful DNA vaccination by multiple routes of inoculation and the high efficiency of gene-gun delivery highlight the potential of this promising new approach to immunization.",1995
s130755,detection and characterization of the prostate-specific membrane antigen (psma) in tissue extracts and body fluids.,"detection and characterization of the prostate-specific membrane antigen (psma) in tissue extracts and body fluids.. The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) glycoprotein is recognized by the monoclonal antibody (MAb) 7E11-C5.3 as a predominant 100 kDa and minor 180 kDa component in LNCaP cell line extracts and its expression has been shown by immunohistochemistry to be highly restricted to prostate epithelium. The aim of the present study was to utilize Western blot analysis to determine if PSMA could be detected in human tissue extracts and body fluids and if so, which molecular forms were present. PSMA was detected as 120 and 200 kDa bands in normal, benign and malignant prostate tissues and seminal plasma. Further analysis demonstrated that the larger molecular form of PSMA may be a dimer of the lower m.w. species. The PSMA glycoprotein was not detected in the majority of non-prostate tissue extracts examined except for a low yet significant amount in normal salivary gland, brain and small intestine, suggesting that PSMA may not be as prostate-specific as originally thought. Since the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has been shown to be maximally shed into the serum in high-grade and metastatic prostate carcinomas, it was surprising that PSMA could not be detected in serum by Western blot analysis even in patients with actively progressive metastatic disease. Second generation antibodies generated against different epitopes may be required to determine if PSMA is shed into serum. Our results support the hypothesis that PSMA is a novel prostate biomarker.",1995

The efficiency of different vaccination techniques to prime in vivo major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted murine cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) precursors to hepatitis B virus small surface antigen (HBsAg) was investigated. Mice were immunized either by injection of a low dose of recombinant HBsAg protein preparations (native HBsAg particles or denatured HBsAg monomers) without adjuvants, by infection with recombinant vaccinia virus carrying an HBsAg-encoding gene, or by intramuscular transfer of plasmid DNA encoding HBsAg under appropriate promoter control. In H-2d mice, an Ld-restricted, S28-39-specific CTL response was efficiently primed by all alternative vaccination techniques tested, but the most potent priming of class I-restricted CTL to HBsAg in vivo was observed with DNA immunization. Priming of anti-HBsAg CTL in H-2b mice was not detectable after infection with a recombinant vaccinia virus or after injection with exogenous recombinant HBsAg preparations. After DNA immunization, however, both Kb- and Db-restricted CTL reactivity to HBsAg emerged in H-2b mice. Hence, nucleic acid immunization revealed class I-restricted CTL responsiveness to HBsAg in a mouse strain previously considered to be a nonresponder at the CTL level. These results demonstrate that the simple technique of nucleic acid immunization not only is extremely efficient but also reveals an extended spectrum of potentially immunogenic epitopes of protein antigens.",1995
s130855,sequential addition of temperature-sensitive missense mutations into the pb2 gene of influenza a transfectant viruses can effect an increase in temperature sensitivity and attenuation and permits the rational design of a genetically engineered live influenza a virus vaccine.,"sequential addition of temperature-sensitive missense mutations into the pb2 gene of influenza a transfectant viruses can effect an increase in temperature sensitivity and attenuation and permits the rational design of a genetically engineered live influenza a virus vaccine.. We have previously described a strategy for the recovery of a synthetic influenza A virus wild-type (wt) PB2 gene (derived from influenza A/Ann Arbor/6/60 [AA] virus) into an infectious virus. It was possible to introduce an attenuating temperature-sensitive (ts) mutation at amino acid residue 265 of the AA wt PB2 gene and to rescue this mutant gene into infectious virus. Application of this new technology to influenza A virus vaccine development requires that multiple attenuating mutations be introduced to achieve a satisfactorily attenuated virus that retains the attenuation (att) phenotype following replication in vivo. In this report, we demonstrate that putative ts mutations at amino acids 112, 556, and 658 each indeed specify the ts and att phenotypes. Each of these mutations was introduced into a cDNA copy of the AA mutant mt265 PB2 gene to produce three double-mutant PB2 genes, each of which was rescued into an infectious virus. In general, the double-mutant PB2 transfectant viruses were more ts and attenuated in the lower respiratory tracts of hamsters than the single-mutant transfectant viruses, and the ts phenotype of two of three double-mutant PB2 transfectant viruses was stable even after prolonged replication in the upper respiratory tracts of immunocompromised mice. Two triple-mutant PB2 transfectant viruses with three predicted amino acid substitutions resulting from five nucleotide substitutions in the cDNA were then generated. The triple-mutant PB2 transfectant viruses were more ts and more attenuated than the double-mutant PB2 transfectant viruses. These results indicate that sequential introduction of additional ts mutations into the PB2 gene can yield mutants that exhibit a stepwise increase in temperature sensitivity and attenuation compared with the preceding mutant(s) in the series. Furthermore, the level of temperature sensitivity of the transfectant viruses correlated significantly with the level of attenuation of these viruses in hamsters. Although the triple-mutant PB2 transfectant viruses were attenuated in hamsters, intranasal administration of these viruses elicited a vigorous serum hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody response, and this was associated with resistance of the lower respiratory tract to subsequent wt virus challenge. These observations suggest the feasibility of using PB2 reverse genetics to generate a live influenza A virus vaccine donor strain that contains three attenuating mutations in one gene. It is predicted that reassortant viruses derived from such a donor virus would have the properties of attenuation, genetic stability, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy against challenge with wt virus.",1995
s130922,immunophenotyping of melanomas for tyrosinase: implications for vaccine development.,"immunophenotyping of melanomas for tyrosinase: implications for vaccine development.. Tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1), the key enzyme in melanin synthesis, has been shown to be one of the targets for cytotoxic T-cell recognition in melanoma patients. To develop serological reagents useful for immunophenotyping melanoma for tyrosinase, human tyrosinase cDNA was expressed in an Escherichia coli expression vector. The purified recombinant tyrosinase was used to generate mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies. The prototype monoclonal antibody, T311, recognized a cluster of protein moieties ranging from 70 to 80 kDa in tyrosinase mRNA-positive melanoma cell lines and melanoma specimens as well as in L cells transfected with tyrosinase cDNA. Untransfected L cells and L cells transfected with tyrosinase-related protein 1, TRP-1(gp75), were nonreactive. Immunohistochemical analysis of melanomas with T311 showed tyrosinase in melanotic and amelanotic variants, and tyrosinase expression correlated with the presence of tyrosinase mRNA. Melanocytes in skin stained with T311, whereas other normal tissues tested were negative. The expression pattern of three melanosome-associated proteins--tyrosinase, TRP-1(gp75), and gp100--in melanoma was also compared. Tyrosinase and gp100 are expressed in a higher percentage of melanomas than TRP-1(gp75), and the expression of these three antigens was discordant. Tyrosinase expression within individual tumor specimen is usually homogenous, distinctly different from the commonly observed heterogeneous pattern of gp100 expression.",1995
s130952,human h-y: a male-specific histocompatibility antigen derived from the smcy protein.,"human h-y: a male-specific histocompatibility antigen derived from the smcy protein.. H-Y is a transplantation antigen that can lead to rejection of male organ and bone marrow grafts by female recipients, even if the donor and recipient match at the major histocompatibility locus of humans, the HLA (human leukocyte antigen) locus. However, the origin and function of H-Y antigens has eluded researchers for 40 years. One human H-Y antigen presented by HLA-B7 was identified as an 11-residue peptide derived from SMCY, an evolutionarily conserved protein encoded on the Y chromosome. The protein from the homologous gene on the X chromosome, SMCX, differs by two amino acid residues in the same region. The identification of H-Y may aid in transplantation prognosis, prenatal diagnosis, and fertilization strategies.",1995
s130961,antigenic differences between european and american isolates of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) are encoded by the carboxyterminal portion of viral open reading frame 3.,"antigenic differences between european and american isolates of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) are encoded by the carboxyterminal portion of viral open reading frame 3.. Antigenic differences between European and American isolates of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) were revealed by serologic analysis of a recombinant protein derived from PRRSV open reading frame 3 (ORF 3). The hydrophilic carboxyterminal 199 amino acids encoded by the ORF 3 of a European (Lelystad) isolate of PRRSV were expressed as a recombinant fusion protein (BP03-P) in a baculovirus gene expression system. Sera from gnotobiotic swine exposed to prototypic reference European and American isolates of PRRSV and sera from conventionally reared European and American swine convalescing from naturally acquired PRRSV infections were used to characterize the BP03-P protein. Sera from gnotobiotic and conventionally reared swine exposed to European isolates of PRRSV were significantly more reactive (P < 0.01) with BP03-P than were the corresponding American PRRSV antisera using the indirect immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA). Prototypic European, but not American, PRRSV antisera also recognized BP03-P using western immunoblotting and radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) procedures. However, gnotobiotically derived antiserum to an atypical American-origin PRRSV was reactive with BP03-P by both IPMA and western immunoblot. Despite a predicted potential for N-linked glycosylation, studies with tunicamycin and peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) indicated that BP03-P was not N-glycosylated in either insect cell cultures or Trichoplusia ni larvae infected with the recombinant baculovirus. Sera from rabbits inoculated with BP03-P failed to neutralize both the European (Lelystad) and American (ATCC VR-2332) reference isolates of PRRSV and did not react by IPMA with PRRSV-infected cell cultures. Taken together, the data suggest that the carboxyterminal portion of PRRSV ORF 3 encodes a non-neutralizing viral peptide that is partially responsible for the serologic differences noted between European and most American isolates of PRRSV.",1995

We have previously demonstrated that induction of antiviral cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), in the absence of antiviral antibodies, can confer protection against a lethal-dose virus challenge.

First, three discrete viral CTL epitopes expressed from minigenes encoding peptides as short as 12 amino acids can be recognized when expressed from recombinant vaccinia virus; second, concentrating on two of the three epitopes, we show that these vaccinia virus recombinants can confer protection in a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted manner; third, the minigenes can be fused to generate a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""string of beads,"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and the close proximity of the two epitopes within one oligopeptide does not disrupt recognition of either epitope; fourth, this string-of-beads vaccine, in contrast to the single epitope vaccines, can protect on both MHC backgrounds; and, fifth, CTL to different epitopes may act synergistically, as protection is improved when the vaccine contains more than one CTL epitope for a given MHC background.",1993
s131381,inducible t cell antigen 4-1bb. analysis of expression and function.,"inducible t cell antigen 4-1bb. analysis of expression and function.. 4-1BB is an inducible receptor-like protein expressed in both cytolytic and Th cells. Optimal induction of 4-1BB mRNA in T cells required both PMA and ionomycin stimulation, indicating that protein kinase C activation and increases in intracellular Ca2+ were required for its expression. 4-1BB was categorized as an early activation gene since the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, blocked the induction of 4-1BB mRNA. A rat mAb, 53A2, was generated against recombinant soluble 4-1BB and was used to characterize this molecule. 4-1BB is a 30-kDa glycoprotein and appears to exist as both a monomer and a 55-kDa dimer on the cell surface of a T cell clone. The 4-1BB protein may be post-translationally modified since its predicted backbone is 25 kDa. FACS analysis indicated that 4-1BB was inducible and expressed on the cell surface of activated splenic T cells and thymocytes. Cross-linking of 4-1BB on anti-CD3-stimulated T cells with 53A2 resulted in a dramatic enhancement of T cell proliferation. This suggests that 4-1BB may function as an accessory signaling molecule during T cell activation.",1993
s131410,localization of a site on bacterial superantigens that determines t cell receptor beta chain specificity.,"localization of a site on bacterial superantigens that determines t cell receptor beta chain specificity.. A defining characteristic of superantigens is their ability to stimulate T cells based predominantly on the type of variable segment of the T cell receptor (TCR) beta chain (V beta). The V beta specificity of these toxins most likely results from direct contact between the toxin and the TCR, although the low affinity nature of this binding has prevented direct assessment of this interaction. To identify important functional sites on the toxin, we created chimeric enterotoxin genes between staphylococcal enterotoxins A and E (SEA and SEE) and tested the V beta specificity of the chimeric toxins. This approach allowed us to identify three amino acid residues in the extreme COOH terminus of these toxins that are largely responsible for their ability to stimulate either human V beta 5- or V beta 8-bearing T cells, or mouse V beta 3 or V beta 11. We also found that residues in the NH2 terminus were required for wild-type levels of V beta-specific T cell activation, suggesting that the NH2 and COOH ends of these superantigens may come together to form the full TCR V beta contact site. SEA and SEE also differ with respect to their class II binding characteristics. Using the same chimeric molecules, we demonstrate that the first third of the molecule controls the class II binding phenotype. These data lead us to propose that for SEA and SEE, and perhaps for all bacterial-derived superantigens, the COOH and NH2 termini together form the contact sites for the TCR and therefore largely determine the V beta specificity of the toxin, while the NH2 terminus alone binds major histocompatibility complex class II molecules. The predominant role of the COOH terminus of bacterial superantigens in determining V beta specificity resembles current models being proposed for virally encoded superantigens, suggesting that these molecules may demonstrate some structural relationship not seen at the amino acid level.",1993

The development of non-living carrier systems for delivery of protective antigens or epitopes to the immune system represents both a fundamental and an applied aspect of vaccinology. A wide range of carrier systems, ranging from inert supports to proteins that exert direct immunomodulating effects on the immune response, are being studied. In this overview we describe the current progress in the development of the B-subunits of cholera toxin and Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin as potential protein carriers for the oral delivery of chemically and genetically attached antigens and epitopes.",1993
s131569,molecular cloning and characterization of the genetic determinants that express the complete shigella serotype d (shigella sonnei) lipopolysaccharide in heterologous live attenuated vaccine strains.,"molecular cloning and characterization of the genetic determinants that express the complete shigella serotype d (shigella sonnei) lipopolysaccharide in heterologous live attenuated vaccine strains.. The genetic determinants for the complete Shigella sonnei lipopolysaccharide (LPS) have been cloned, characterized by restriction mapping, and expressed in heterologous genetic backgrounds, including Salmonella typhi and Vibrio cholerae live attenuated vaccine strains. The rfb/rfc locus encoding the polymerized serotype-specific O polysaccharide was mapped within 23 kb of DNA isolated from S. sonnei virulence plasmid pWR105. A highly similar chromosomal DNA sequence was identified by Southern hybridization analysis in Plesiomonas shigelloides known to have the same O serotype specificity as S. sonnei. Expression studies of the rfb/rfc locus have shown that S. sonnei O polysaccharide is covalently bound to LPS cores of both the K-12 and R1 types, but neither to Salmonella (Ra-type) nor to V. cholerae O1 cores. In order to express a compatible core structure in the latter organisms, chromosomal rfa loci encoding R1-type LPS were isolated from both an Escherichia coli R1 strain (rfaR1) and from S. sonnei (rfasonnei). Restriction mapping and functional analysis of cloned DNA allowed us to localize the rfaR1 locus and to orient it with respect to the neighbouring cysE chromosomal marker. A high degree of sequence similarity was found at the DNA level between rfa loci of enterobacterial species characterized by R1-type LPS. Co-expression studies involving S. sonnei rfb/rfc and rfa loci propagated on compatible plasmids have shown that, at most, 13 to 14 kb of rfaR1 DNA are required for the expression of complete phase-I-like S. sonnei LPS in E. coli K-12 and S. typhi, whereas an adjacent region of about 3.5 kb is needed in the more stringent host, V. cholerae. S. sonnei O antigen expressed in a V. cholerae recombinant vaccine strain is present on the cell surface in a form suitable for the induction of a specific antibody response in vaccinated rabbits.",1993
s131575,aberrant transcription caused by the insertion of an early transposable element in an intron of the fas antigen gene of lpr mice.,"aberrant transcription caused by the insertion of an early transposable element in an intron of the fas antigen gene of lpr mice.. The mouse lpr (lymphoproliferation) mutation carries a rearrangement in the chromosomal gene for the Fas antigen, which mediates apoptosis. Isolation and characterization of mouse Fas antigen chromosomal gene from wild-type and lpr mice indicated an insertion of an early transposable element (ETn) in intron 2 of the Fas antigen gene of lpr mice. Hybrid transcripts carrying the Fas antigen and ETn sequences were expressed in the thymus and liver of the mutant. This indicated that premature termination and aberrant splicing of the Fas antigen transcript caused by the insertion of the ETn in the intron are responsible for the lymphoproliferation and autoimmune phenotype of the mutant mouse. On the other hand, an insertion of the ETn into an intron of a mammalian expression vector dramatically but not completely reduced the expression efficiency. These findings suggest that lpr mice are able to express a very low level of the Fas antigen.",1993
s131676,analysis of proteins encoded by ie regions 1 and 2 of human cytomegalovirus using monoclonal antibodies generated against recombinant antigens.,"analysis of proteins encoded by ie regions 1 and 2 of human cytomegalovirus using monoclonal antibodies generated against recombinant antigens.. The genomic region of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encoding the major immediate-early (IE) proteins was cloned as overlapping fragments into a prokaryotic expression vector. Three recombinant polypeptides were used as antigens to generate monoclonal antibodies specifically reactive with the proteins encoded by IE region 1 and IE region 2. At least 10 different antigenic regions were identified on the IE proteins of HCMV. One monoclonal generated against an IE-2 polypeptide of 156 amino acids (termed SMX) was found to react with a viral pentapeptide, which was also a constituent of the beta-chain of human HLA-DR. This peptide was contained in the 40-kDa (p40) protein encoded by IE region 2. This protein appeared to be an abundant product of the major IE region in infected cells at late times after infection. The putative translation initiation site for p40 was mapped to position 3348 of the IE2 sequence using monoclonal antibody SMX. It is therefore proposed that p40 consists of amino acids 242-580 encoded by the IE2 gene of HCMV (strain AD169). Neither this late protein nor any other of the IE1/IE2-encoded proteins was detectable in extracellular virions.",1993
s131678,identification of hiv vaccine candidate peptides by screening random phage epitope libraries.,"identification of hiv vaccine candidate peptides by screening random phage epitope libraries.. Most synthetic HIV-1 gp120 V3 loop peptides that are used as immunogens in experimental HIV-1 vaccine studies are modeled from the naturally occurring viral gp120 V3 loops. In experimental animals these immunogens generally elicit type (or variant)-specific neutralizing antibodies that are not broadly reactive among HIV-1 variants. In an attempt to find a more general structure for the V3 loop, we have obtained candidates that mimic V3 loop sequences by screening random epitopes displayed in a fusion phage 15-residue epitope library. Human monoclonal antibody 447-52D, a highly potent and broadly reactive virus-neutralizing antibody that recognizes the conserved V3 loop tip motif GPXR, was the probe. By using a screening method that was designed specifically for this work, we identified hundreds of reactive phage clones, 70 of which were sequenced. Over 98% of the epitopes contain the motif GPXR, yet none of the 70 are an identical match to any V3 variant loop described to date. One of these sequences was synthesized as the beta-maleimidopropionyl 15-mer peptide, covalently conjugated to a carrier and used to immunize rabbits. High anti-peptide titers were obtained in all animals with three of four individual responses also binding to a peptide that is representative of the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""North American consensus"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" V3 loop. The sera from these three positive rabbits neutralized HIV-1 variant SF-2 in vitro. In addition, one of them was capable of neutralizing variant AL-1.

Thus, neutralizing responses were obtained by use of an immunogen that was selected for its ability to bind a broadly reactive human monoclonal antibody rather than modeled from an HIV-1 gp120 V3 loop sequence.",1993
s131780,dominance and crypticity of t cell antigenic determinants.,"dominance and crypticity of t cell antigenic determinants.. In this review, we first consider the inherent structural constraints for binding of a peptide to MHC class II molecules. Such parameters at the site of TCR recognition are dependent upon the efficient generation of the antigenic determinant during natural processing of the whole protein antigen. Strikingly, only a minor fraction of such potential determinants on an antigen are presented in an immunodominant manner, while the remaining peptides are silent (cryptic). Why one determinant is selected while the majority are neglected is still unresolved, but we review the experimental evidence pertaining to this choice. Thus, features of the antigen remote from the actual determinant can either steer processing toward disclosure or revelation of a determinant, or interfere with the binding of peptides to MHC (hinderotopy). The evidence is reviewed for """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""MHC-guided processing,"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" where the unfolding antigen binds at an early stage to an MHC molecule through its most available and affine agretope and then is trimmed down to final size, while the rest of the molecule, including cryptic determinants, is discarded. Different MHC molecules can compete for determinants at an early stage of processing when the antigen is close to its original length. There are shifts in the hierarchy of display of dominant and cryptic determinants, and these shifts relate to local inflammatory states, to changes in the state or composition of the APC population, and to aspects of exogenous vs endogenous processing. The impact of this differential display of determinants on tolerance and autoimmunity is discussed.",1993
s131822,hla a2 restricted cytotoxic t lymphocyte responses to multiple hepatitis b surface antigen epitopes during hepatitis b virus infection.,"hla a2 restricted cytotoxic t lymphocyte responses to multiple hepatitis b surface antigen epitopes during hepatitis b virus infection.. Inasmuch as the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is not directly cytopathic for the infected hepatocyte, it is generally presumed that viral clearance and liver cell injury during viral hepatitis are due to a CTL response to HBV encoded Ag presented by HLA class I molecules. We have previously examined the peripheral blood CTL response to two HBV nucleocapsid epitopes in patients with acute and chronic viral hepatitis, one of which is restricted by HLA-A2, whereas the other is dually restricted by HLA-A31 and Aw68. In this study, we defined the HLA-A2-restricted CTL response to the hepatitis B surface Ag (HBsAg) by using a panel of HBsAg-derived synthetic peptides containing the ideal HLA-A2.1 binding motif (-L------V). Several novel aspects of HBV immunobiology and pathogenesis are evident from this study. First, the peripheral blood CTL response to HBV-encoded Ag is remarkably polyclonal and multispecific in most patients with acute hepatitis. Indeed, HLA-A2-restricted CTL specific for as many as four envelope epitopes and one nucleocapsid epitope were found to be present simultaneously in individual patients with acute viral hepatitis. Second, HBV-specific CTL are not detectable in the peripheral blood in a minority of patients with acute hepatitis, nor have we detected a CTL response in any of the patients with chronic hepatitis that we have studied thus far. Although the cellular and molecular basis for CTL nonresponse remains to be determined, the data suggest that it may contribute to viral persistence. Third, the diversity and the specificity of the CTL response is determined in part by the coding sequence of the viral genome present in each infected patient. Indeed, the apparent nonresponse of some acutely infected patients to at least one HBsAg-specific CTL epitope actually reflects infection by a viral variant that contains a critical substitution in one of the anchor residues within the epitope. Finally, at a fundamental level, the data suggest that the presence of the HLA-A2.1-binding motif in a peptide may not be sufficient for binding; and the capacity of a peptide to bind the class I molecule does not guarantee that it will be immunogenic.",1993

s132275,marked increase in the secretion of a fully antigenic recombinant carcinoembryonic antigen obtained by deletion of its hydrophobic tail.,"marked increase in the secretion of a fully antigenic recombinant carcinoembryonic antigen obtained by deletion of its hydrophobic tail.. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a well-known tumor marker, consisting of a single heavily glycosylated polypeptide chain (mol. wt 200 kD), bound to the cell surface by a phosphatidylinositol-glycan anchor. The hydrophobic domain, encoded by the 3' end of the open reading frame of the CEA gene is not present in the mature protein. This domain is assumed to play an important role in the targeting and attachment of CEA to the cell surface. To verify this hypothesis, a recombinant CEA cDNA lacking the 78 b.p. of the 3' region, encoding the 26 a.a. hydrophobic domain, was prepared in a Rc/CMV expression vector containing a neomycin resistance gene. The construct was transfected by the calcium phosphate technique into CEA-negative human and rat colon carcinoma cell lines. Geneticin-resistant transfectants were screened for the presence of CEA in the supernatant and positive clones were isolated. As determined by ELISA, up to 13 micrograms of recombinant CEA per 10(6) cells was secreted within 72 hr by the human transfected cells and about 1 microgram by the rat cells. For comparison, two human carcinoma cell lines, CO112 and LS174T, selected for high CEA expression, shed about 45 and 128 ng per 10(6) cells within 72 hr, respectively. Western blot analysis showed that the size of the recombinant CEA secreted by the transfected human cells is identical to that of reference CEA purified from human colon carcinomas metastases (about 200 kD). The recombinant CEA synthesized by the transfected rat carcinoma cells has a smaller size (about 144 kD, possibly due to incomplete glycosylation), as has already been observed for CEA produced by rat colon carcinoma cells transfected with full-length CEA cDNA. The 100-fold increase in secretion of rCEA encoded by truncated CEA cDNA transfected in human cells confirms the essential role of this domain in the targeting and anchoring of the glycoprotein. These results suggest a new approach for the in vitro production of large amounts of CEA needed in research laboratories and for immunoassay kits.",1993
s132280,human t-cell clonal anergy is induced by antigen presentation in the absence of b7 costimulation.,"human t-cell clonal anergy is induced by antigen presentation in the absence of b7 costimulation.. The maximal T-cell response to its antigen requires presentation of the antigen by a major histocompatibility complex class II molecule as well as the delivery of one or more costimulatory signals provided by the antigen-presenting cell (APC). Although a number of candidate molecules have been identified that are capable of delivering a costimulatory signal, increasing evidence suggests that one such critical pathway involves the interaction of the T-cell surface antigen CD28 with its ligand B7, expressed on APCs. In view of the number of potential costimulatory molecules that might be expressed on the cell surface of APCs, artificial APCs were constructed by stable transfection of NIH 3T3 cells with HLA-DR7, B7, or both. Here, we show that in a human antigen-specific model system, when tetanus toxoid peptide antigen is presented by cells cotransfected with HLA-DR7 and B7, optimal T-cell proliferation and interleukin 2 production result. In contrast, antigen presentation, in the absence of B7 costimulation, results in T-cell clonal anergy. These results demonstrate that it is possible to induce antigen-specific clonal tolerance in human T cells that have been previously sensitized to antigen. The artificial antigen-presenting system provides a useful model for the investigation of the biochemical events involved in the generation of tolerance and for the study of signals necessary to overcome tolerance.",1993
s132310,detection of organ-confined prostate cancer is increased through prostate-specific antigen-based screening.,"detection of organ-confined prostate cancer is increased through prostate-specific antigen-based screening.. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening alters the proportion of organ-confined prostate cancers detected. DESIGN: A prospective, nonrandomized, serial PSA-based screening trial (follow-up from 6 to 37 months), and a concurrent comparison group. SETTING: General community outpatient screening program based at a university center. PATIENTS: The study group consisted of 10,251 men aged 50 years and older (mean and median age, 63 years; mean and median age of patients who underwent biopsies, 66 years) who presented to a prostate cancer screening program and consented to phlebotomy. The comparison group consisted of 266 concurrently studied private patients in the same age range (mean and median age, 68 years) who were referred for prostatic ultrasonography and biopsy because of an abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Proportion detected with clinically or pathologically advanced prostate cancer. RESULTS: The men were divided into three groups: the comparison group, the initial PSA-based screening group, and the serial PSA-based screening group. The proportions of prostate cancers detected that were clinically or pathologically advanced were as follows: comparison group, 57% (27/47); initial PSA-based screening group, 37% (91/244); and serial PSA-based screening group, 29% (37/129). Screened patients had a lower proportion of advanced cancers than the comparison group (chi 2 [2] = 12.3; P = .002); this advantage was observed principally in patients younger than 70 years. Surgical staging revealed that the cancer was microscopically focal and well differentiated (possibly latent cancer) in 2.5% (1/40) of the nonscreened group, 2.9% (7/244) of the initially screened group, and 7.8% (10/129) of the serially screened group (generalized Fisher's Exact Test, P = .08). CONCLUSION: Screening based on PSA identifies some men with prostate cancer who have a significantly increased proportion of organ-confined tumors compared with those detected through evaluation for an abnormal DRE alone.",1993
s132495,analysis of antigens recognized on human melanoma cells by a2-restricted cytolytic t lymphocytes (ctl).,"analysis of antigens recognized on human melanoma cells by a2-restricted cytolytic t lymphocytes (ctl).. We have pursued our analysis of potential tumor-rejection antigens recognized on human melanoma by autologous cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL). We reported previously that 3 distinct antigens (A,B,C) were recognized on melanoma cell line SK29-MEL in association with HLA-A2. Selection for melanoma-cell variants resistant to anti-A CTL revealed that antigen A consists of at least 2 determinants (Aa, Ab) which can be lost separately. Genetic linkage between Aa and Ab was suggested by concomitant loss of Aa and Ab in an immunoselected tumor-cell variant. This variant was also resistant to an autologous CTL clone restricted by HLA-B45, indicating that this CTL may also recognize a determinant of antigen A. Of 11 allogeneic HLA-A2 melanoma cell lines that were tested, 5 expressed both Aa and Ab, 1 expressed only Aa, and 1 only Ab. None of them was lysed by anti-B or anti-C CTL clones. A CTL clone derived from another HLA-A2-melanoma patient was found to have exactly the same lytic pattern as the anti-Ab CTL of the first patient. This suggested that it may be possible to elicit an anti-Ab response in many HLA-A2 patients. We conclude that there are at least 2 distinct antigens presented in association with HLA-A2 that are common to many melanomas and therefore constitute promising targets for specific immunotherapy.",1993
s132574,"retrospective: 12 years of antigenic determinant predictions, and more.","retrospective: 12 years of antigenic determinant predictions, and more.. The Hopp and Woods hydrophilicity method for locating antigenic determinants was published in 1981. In the years since then, the method has been used widely and has played a vital role in many antigenic structure studies. The method has been criticized occasionally and replacements for it have been proposed. However, at this time, the Hopp and Woods method remains a method of choice for identifying antigenic sites and other protein interaction sites, because it has a higher success rate than other similar methods. Key to the success of this method is its cautious approach to charge-charge interactions, giving equal weight to positively and negatively charged residues, whereas other methods tend to favor one or the other. It has become clear that sites chosen by our method tend to be highly exposed, charged regions of the protein's surface which project into the environment and therefore have ample opportunity to contact other proteins. We have been exploring new uses for the method, and have found some applications in locating sites for other types of interactions, including those with other macromolecules such as DNA and RNA. It seems likely that this simple and reliable procedure will continue to find use in predicting the locations of major antigenic epitopes, and may also find use as a general prediction method to identify interaction sites on proteins that make charge-dependent contacts with a variety of other biological macromolecules.",1993
s132650,function of the rfb gene cluster and the rfe gene in the synthesis of o antigen by shigella dysenteriae 1.,"function of the rfb gene cluster and the rfe gene in the synthesis of o antigen by shigella dysenteriae 1.. A plasmid that included both an 8.9 kb chromosomal DNA insert containing genes from the rfb cluster of Shigella dysenteriae 1 and a smaller insert containing the rfp gene from a S. dysenteriae 1 multicopy plasmid resulted in efficient expression of O antigen in an rfb-deleted strain of Escherichia coli K-12. Eight genes were identified in the rfb fragment: the rfbB-CAD cluster which encodes dTDP-rhamnose synthesis, rfbX which encodes a hydrophobic protein involved in assembly of the O antigen, rfc which encodes the O antigen polymerase, and two sugar transferase genes. The production of an O antigen also required the E. coli K-12 rfe gene, which is known to encode a transferase which adds N-acetylglucosamine phosphate to the carrier lipid undecaprenol phosphate. Thus Rfe protein appears to function as an analogue of the Salmonella RfbP protein to provide the first sugar of the O unit. Functional analysis of the other genes was facilitated by the fact that partial O units of one, two or three sugars were efficiently transferred to the lipopolysaccharide core. This analysis indicated that the plasmid-encoded Rfp protein is the transferase that adds the second sugar of the O unit while the two rfb transferases add the distal sugars to make an O antigen whose structure is (Rha-Rha-Gal-GlcNAc)n. The use of the rfe gene product as the transferase that adds the first sugar of an O unit is a novel mechanism which may be used for the synthesis of other enteric O antigens.",1993
s132741,functional and immunological relevance of the cooh-terminal extension of human chorionic gonadotropin beta: implications for the who birth control vaccine.,"functional and immunological relevance of the cooh-terminal extension of human chorionic gonadotropin beta: implications for the who birth control vaccine.. The World Health Organisation (WHO) Task Force on Birth Control Vaccines has selected the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) as a target molecule for a contraceptive vaccine. A synthetic peptide antigen corresponding to the amino acid sequence 109-145 of the carboxyl-terminal portion of the hCG beta-subunit (hCG beta CTP), which is supposed to elicit hCG-immunoneutralizing antibodies, has been submitted to clinical trials. Recent findings suggest that hCG beta CTP does not play a role in the biological activity of hCG. This raises the question concerning the assumed mechanism of action of the hCG beta CTP-based birth control vaccine. We therefore investigated the immunoneutralizing capacity of antibodies directed against hCG beta CTP. Although it is possible to generate specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies for hCG by using hCG beta CTP as an immunogen, it appeared that the biological response to hCG was not affected by such antibodies. The reason for this is that the hCG-antibody-complex is still able to bind to target cell receptors and therefore the intended contraceptive effect should not occur. In addition there is a risk of hazardous possible side effects such as an autoimmune reaction against the ovary because we found that at least one epitope is still accessible for antibody binding on receptor-bound hCG. We conclude from our results that both the efficacy and safety of the WHO vaccine are not yet ensured.",1993
s132803,b70 antigen is a second ligand for ctla-4 and cd28.,"b70 antigen is a second ligand for ctla-4 and cd28.. The membrane antigen B7/BB1 (refs 1, 2) is expressed on activated B cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, and binds to a counter-receptor, CD28, expressed on T lymphocytes and thymocytes. Interaction between CD28 and B7 results in potent costimulation of T-cell activation initiated through the CD3/T-cell receptor complex. Discrepancies between results with anti-CD28 and anti-B7 antibodies have suggested the existence of a second ligand for CD28 and CTLA-4 (refs 3, 6-8). We have generated a monoclonal antibody, IT2, that reacts with a 70K glycoprotein (B70). B70 complementary DNA was cloned from a B-lymphoblastoid cell line library and encodes a new protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily with limited homology to B7. B70 is expressed on resting monocytes and dendritic cells and on activated, but not resting, T, NK and B lymphocytes. IT2 substantially inhibited the binding of a CTLA4-immunoglobulin fusion protein to human B-lymphoblastoid cell lines and, together with anti-B7 antibody, completely blocked CTLA-4 binding. Further IT2 efficiently inhibited primary allogeneic mixed lymphocyte responses. These findings indicate that B70 is a second ligand for CD28 and CTLA-4 and may play an important role for costimulation of T cells in a primary immune response.",1993
s132856,comparison of humoral immune responses and tumor immunity in mice immunized with recombinant sv40 large tumor antigen and a monoclonal anti-idiotype.,"comparison of humoral immune responses and tumor immunity in mice immunized with recombinant sv40 large tumor antigen and a monoclonal anti-idiotype.. We compared the humoral immune responses induced in BALB/c mice by immunization with recombinant SV40 large tumor antigen (T-ag) with those induced by a monoclonal anti-idiotype (anti-Id), designated 58D, that is specific for SV40 T-ag-induced Id network components. We also challenged immunized mice with a lethal dose of SV40-transformed cells to assess in vivo tumor immunity. Two biweekly immunization with either SV40 T-ag or anti-Id 58D induced humoral responses that recognized both SV40 T-ag and anti-Id 58D. Four biweekly immunizations with SV40 T-ag increased the antigen-specific antibody titers and decreased the response to anti-Id 58D, while four biweekly immunizations of anti-Id 58D increased antibody titers to both itself and SV40 T-ag. Comparison of specific T-ag epitope and idiotope specificities indicated that SV40 T-ag and anti-Id 58D immunization generated responses that recognized a similar epitope on SV40 T-ag and expressed a shared idiotope recognized by anti-Id 58D. SV40 T-ag immunized mice challenged with a lethal dose of SV40-transformed cells were completely protected and no tumors were observed. This is despite the fact that little or no SV40 T-ag-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity was detectable. In contrast, only 3 of 10 mice immunized with anti-Id 58D were protected from a lethal challenge. These results indicate that, although monoclonal anti-Id immunization can induce responses that recognize similar SV40 T-ag epitopes and express shared idiotopes associated with antibodies to SV40 T-ag, the recombinant antigen itself induces superior in vivo tumor immunity.",1993
s133029,detection and differentiation of antigenically distinct small round-structured viruses (norwalk-like viruses) by reverse transcription-pcr and southern hybridization.,"detection and differentiation of antigenically distinct small round-structured viruses (norwalk-like viruses) by reverse transcription-pcr and southern hybridization.. Application of reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to detect small round-structured viruses (SRSVs) from fecal specimens of patients with gastroenteritis has been insensitive because of the tremendous sequence heterogeneity between strains. We have designed two RT-PCR primer sets (G-1 and G-2) based on the nucleotide sequence diversity in the RNA polymerase gene of SRSVs belonging to two distinct genogroups represented by Norwalk virus (primers G-1) and Snow Mountain agent (primers G-2). All 22 SRSV strains examined that had been classified previously by solid-phase immune electron microscopy into four antigenic types (UK1, UK2, UK3, and UK4) could be detected by RT-PCR with these two primer sets. The G-1 primer set detected 6 UK2 strains, and the G-2 primers detected 16 strains, including 7 UK1, 5 UK3, and 4 UK4 strains. On the basis of nucleotide sequences of 81-bp fragments of the RT-PCR products from 13 strains determined in this study, together with those previously reported for 17 SRSV strains, we designed four sets of internal oligonucleotide probes (P1-A, P1-B, P2-A, and P2-B) for Southern hybridization, using chemiluminescent detection. The P1-A probe hybridized with PCR products from the UK2 strains; the P1-B probe, with products from two of the seven UK1 strains; the P2-A probe, with four of the remaining five UK1 strains; and the P2-B probe, with products from both UK3 and UK4 strains, as well as with one strain originally typed as UK1 which showed cross-reactivity with UK4 upon retesting by solid-phase immune electron microscopy. RT-PCR with both the G-1 and the G-2 primer sets can increase the detection rate of the many antigenically distinct SRSVs and, when combined with Southern hybridization, may predict the antigenic type of the SRSV associated with infection.",1995
s133174,immunotherapy of cancer using cytokine gene-modified tumor vaccines.,"immunotherapy of cancer using cytokine gene-modified tumor vaccines.. Distant metastasis is the major cause for therapeutic failures in clinical oncology. Active immunotherapy of patients with low tumor burden would not only contribute to further reduction of the remaining tumor burden to subclinical levels, but it would also establish a constant state of immunity, i.e. immunological memory, that could protect the patient from recurrence of disease. Studies employing rodent tumor models with little or no intrinsic immunogenicity have shown that genitically modified tumor cell preparations consisting of irradiated tumor cells transduced with and expressing cytokines such as IL-2, IL-6, IFN-gamma or GM-CSF were capable of inducing the regression of a preexisting tumor burden and cure animals from their disease. Moreover, in some instances the cured animals have retained immunological memory, as indicated by the fact that such animals have resisted a second challenge with the parental tumor cells. Induction of potent immune responses in tumor bearing animals against non-immunogenic tumors supports the view that active immunization of cancer patients deserves consideration despite lack of demonstrable immunogenicity in many human tumors.",1994

The rpoS (katF) gene, which encodes a RNA polymerase sigma factor (sigma s), regulates the virulence of Salmonella typhimurium in mice. In the present study, we show that rpoS mutants can be frequently found among laboratory strains of Salmonella. In addition, a rpoS mutation was identified in the S. typhi live oral vaccine Ty21a. Introduction of a wild-type rpoS gene in Ty21a allowed the bacteria to survive better under starvation conditions and increased their resistance to other stresses. These results contribute to a better understanding of the genetic background of the live typhoid oral vaccine Ty21a and suggest that the rpoS mutation may contribute to the safety of this strain in humans.",1995
s133456,macrophage-inducible expression of a model antigen in salmonella typhimurium enhances immunogenicity.,"macrophage-inducible expression of a model antigen in salmonella typhimurium enhances immunogenicity.. Attenuated Salmonella are useful oral vaccine vectors capable of carrying multiple heterologous antigen genes, but optimal expression of foreign antigens has not yet been achieved. We hypothesized that Salmonella phoP-activated genes, which are transcriptionally activated within antigen-processing macrophages, could prove useful for delivery of heterologous antigens to the immune system. We have created a suicide vector that allows the stable chromosomal insertion of heterologous antigen genes within the phoP-activated gene C (pagC) of Salmonella and permits the expression of heterologous antigens as fusion proteins between the first 84 amino acids of PagC and the chosen antigen. The Escherichia coli phoA gene encoding alkaline phosphatase was cloned into this vector; the resultant plasmid was used to construct Salmonella typhimurium strains that express PagC-alkaline phosphatase fusion proteins from a single chromosomal gene copy. Such strains were administered orally and i.p. as vaccines to BALB/c mice and compared with control strains expressing alkaline phosphatase constitutively. After 3 weeks, mouse sera were analyzed for IgG responses to S. typhimurium lipopolysaccharide and alkaline phosphatase. Remarkably, though all mice had comparable antibody responses to lipopolysaccharide, only mice immunized with strains bearing phoP-activated fusion genes had antibody responses to the heterologous antigen. We conclude that expression of a heterologous antigen from an S. typhimurium in vivo-induced promoter that is activated within macrophages markedly enhances the immunogenicity of a model antigen expressed from a single chromosomal gene copy.",1995
s133937,mucosal immunization with a bacterial protein antigen genetically coupled to cholera toxin a2/b subunits.,"mucosal immunization with a bacterial protein antigen genetically coupled to cholera toxin a2/b subunits.. The generation of secretory IgA Abs for specific immune protection of mucosal surfaces depends on stimulation of the mucosal immune system, but this is not effectively achieved by parenteral or even oral administration of most soluble Ags. To harness the exceptional mucosal immunogenicity of cholera toxin (CT), which is largely attributed to the cell-binding property of its B subunit, for the generation of other oral vaccines, we have genetically replaced the toxic A1 subunit of CT with a 42-kDa segment of a streptococcal protein adhesin. This construct was expressed in Escherichia coli as a chimeric protein that retained the GM1 ganglioside-binding activity of CT subunit B and the antigenicity of the streptococcal adhesin, as shown by GM1-ELISA developed with Abs to the steptococcal segment. The protein composition of chromatographically purified chimeric protein was verified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with Abs to both antigenic components of the construct. Peroral administration of this chimeric immunogen in mice elicited high levels of mucosal IgA and serum IgG Abs to the streptococcal adhesin, which persisted for at least 6 mo. This strategy allows the development of similar constructs from other candidate Ags for oral immunization against a variety of mucosally acquired infections.",1995
s133938,antigen processing in vivo and the elicitation of primary ctl responses.,"antigen processing in vivo and the elicitation of primary ctl responses.. CD8+ T lymphocytes (TCD8+) play an important role in cellular immune responses. TCD8+ recognize MHC class I molecules complexed to peptides of 8 to 10 residues derived largely from cytosolic proteins. Proteins are generally thought to be fragmented in the cytoplasm and delivered to nascent class I molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by a peptide transporter encoded by the MHC. To explore the extent to which TCD8+ induction in vivo is limited by proteolysis or peptide transport into the ER, mice were immunized with recombinant vaccinia viruses containing mini-genes encoding antigenic peptides (bypassing the need for proteolysis), or these peptides with a NH2-terminal ER insertion sequence (bypassing the requirements for both proteolysis and transport). Additionally, mice were immunized with recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding rapidly degraded fragments of proteins. We report that limitations in induction of TCD8+ responses vary among Ags: for some, full length proteins are as immunogenic as other forms tested; for others, maximal responses are induced by peptides or by peptides targeted to the ER. Most importantly, in every circumstance examined, targeting peptides to the ER never diminished, and in some cases greatly enhanced, the TCD8+ immune response and provide an important alternative strategy in the design of live viral or naked DNA vaccines for the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases.",1995
s133942,active immunotherapy of cancer with a nonreplicating recombinant fowlpox virus encoding a model tumor-associated antigen.,"active immunotherapy of cancer with a nonreplicating recombinant fowlpox virus encoding a model tumor-associated antigen.. Some tumor cells express Ags that are potentially recognizable by T lymphocytes and yet do not elicit significant immune responses. To explore new immunotherapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing the recognition of these tumor-associated Ags (TAA), we developed an experimental mouse model consisting of a lethal clone of the BALB/c tumor line CT26 designated CT26.WT, which was transduced with the lacZ gene encoding beta-galactosidase, to create CT26.CL25. The growth rate and lethality of CT26.CL25 and CT26.WT were virtually identical despite the expression by CT26.CL25 of the model tumor Ag in vivo. A recombinant fowlpox virus (rFPV), which is replication incompetent in mammalian cells, was constructed that expressed the model TAA, beta-galactosidase, under the influence of the 40-kDa vaccinia virus early/late promoter. This recombinant, FPV.bg40k, functioned effectively in vivo as an immunogen, eliciting CD8+ T cells that could effectively lyse CT26.CL25 in vitro. FPV.bg40k protected mice from both subcutaneous and intravenous tumor challenge by CT26.CL25, and most surprisingly, mice bearing established 3-day pulmonary metastasis were found to have significant, Ag-specific decreases in tumor burden and prolonged survival after treatment with the rFPV. These observations constitute the first reported use of rFPV in the prevention and treatment of an experimental cancer and suggest that changing the context in which the immune system encounters a TAA can significantly and therapeutically alter the host immune response against cancer.",1995

These peptides are derived from proteins synthesized or residing in the cytoplasm or nucleus, and involves proteasomes and the ubiquitin pathway of protein degradation, as well as a specific peptide transporter (TAP) that allows these peptides access to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The exogenous pathway provides peptides to MHC class II molecules for presentation to CD4+ T cells. These peptides are derived from extracellular antigens taken up by endocytosis and degraded in the endosomal/lysosomal pathway. Peptide loading of MHC class II molecules requires the presence of a molecule (H-2M in mouse, HLA-DM in humans) that is structurally related to MHC class II molecules, but the mechanistic basis of this requirement is unknown. The class II region of the MHC contains a cluster of genes encoding proteins involved in antigen processing, including genes for two proteasome subunits (LMP2 and LMP7), the peptide transporter heterodimer (TAP1 and TAP2), and the H-2M/HLA-DM molecule (Ma and Mb, or DMA and DMB).",1995
s134000,mapping of the antigenic and allergenic epitopes of lol p vb using gene fragmentation.,"mapping of the antigenic and allergenic epitopes of lol p vb using gene fragmentation.. The recombinant proteins of Lol p VA and Lol p VB expressed in E. coli reacted with IgE antibodies from sera of allergic patients and mAbs FMC A7 and PpV1. Cross-absorption analyses using these recombinant proteins showed that Lol p VA and Lol p VB possess both similar and unique IgE binding determinants. Gene fragmentation was utilized to localize the antigenic and allergenic determinants of Lol p VB. When full-length cDNA of Lol p VB was digested into three fragments and expressed as the fusions from the glutathione transferase of pGEX vectors, fragments Met1-Val196 and Asp197-Val339 bound IgE while fragment Met1-Pro96 did not. The data suggest that there are at least two IgE binding determinants in Lol p VB. In addition, only fragment Met1-Val196 reacted with mAb PpV1. The localization of these determinants was further resolved using random fragment expression libraries. The mAb PpV1 determinant was near the N-terminal region of Lol p VB molecule. The IgE binding determinants were distributed in the central region: region I (amino acids 111-195) and II (199-254). These IgE binding determinants are conserved in Lol p VA.",1995
s134031,immunogenicity of transgenic plant-derived hepatitis b surface antigen.,"immunogenicity of transgenic plant-derived hepatitis b surface antigen.. The focus of the Children's Vaccine Initiative is to encourage the discovery of technology that will make vaccines more readily available to developing countries. Our strategy has been to genetically engineer plants so that they can be used as inexpensive alternatives to fermentation systems for production of subunit antigens. In this paper we report on the immunological response elicited in vivo by using recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen (rHBsAg) purified from transgenic tobacco leaves. The anti-hepatitis B response to the tobacco-derived rHBsAg was qualitatively similar to that obtained by immunizing mice with yeast-derived rHBsAg (commercial vaccine). Additionally, T cells obtained from mice primed with the tobacco-derived rHBsAg could be stimulated in vitro by the tobacco-derived rHBsAg, yeast-derived rHBsAg, and by a synthetic peptide that represents part of the a determinant located in the S region (139-147) of HBsAg. Further support for the integrity of the T-cell epitope of the tobacco-derived rHBsAg was obtained by testing the ability of the primed T cells to proliferate in vitro after stimulation with a monoclonal anti-idiotype and an anti-idiotype-derived peptide, both of which mimic the group-specific a determinant of HBsAg. In total, we have conclusively demonstrated that both B- and T-cell epitopes of HBsAg are preserved when the antigen is expressed in a transgenic plant.",1995
s134054,s. typhi vaccine strain ty21a can cause a generalized infection in whole body-irradiated but not in hydrocortisone-treated mice.,"s. typhi vaccine strain ty21a can cause a generalized infection in whole body-irradiated but not in hydrocortisone-treated mice.. Various mutations including galE- in the S.typhi vaccine strain Ty21a are thought to prevent proliferation of these micro-organisms in the host, and elimination of Ty21a would occur independent of the immune system of the host. To investigate this issue, we determined whether Ty21a can proliferate in immunosuppressed mice, and assessed the role of phagocytes in the eradication of Ty21a from tissues. Mice were rendered lymphocytopenic and monocytopenic by hydrocortisone s.c., or were made leucocytopenic by whole body irradiation. Bacteria were injected into a tail vene to evaluate eradication from the blood, liver and spleen, and into thigh muscle, i.e. a tissue that lacks resident macrophages. Ty21a were grown overnight in glucose [glu], or galactose and glucose [gal.glu]; only the Ty21a [gal.glu] expressed somatic O-antigens. After i.v. injection of 10(4) to 10(6) micro-organisms, Ty21a were rapidly eliminated from the liver and spleen of normal and immunosuppressed mice, i.e. within 1 day a 95% reduction of bacterial counts was observed. After i.m. injection of 10(4) to 10(6) bacteria, the number of viable Ty21a decreased in normal and hydrocortisone-treated mice, but in irradiated mice the micro-organisms proliferated and caused generalized infection. In all cases, Ty21a [glu] was eliminated more rapidly than Ty21a [gal.glu], confirming reports that killing of bacteria that lack O-antigens is more rapid than that of smooth bacteria of the same species. These results indicate that elimination of the vaccine strain against typhoid fever, Ty21a, from host tissues is not due to an intrinsic property of the micro-organisms that prevents proliferation but instead depends on the action of resident macrophages and exudate monocytes and granulocytes.",1995
s134210,purification and characterization of a low-molecular-mass t-cell antigen secreted by mycobacterium tuberculosis.,"purification and characterization of a low-molecular-mass t-cell antigen secreted by mycobacterium tuberculosis.. A novel immunogenic antigen, the 6-kDa early secretory antigenic target (ESAT-6), from short-term culture filtrates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography and anion-exchange chromatography by use of fast protein liquid chromatography. The antigen focused at two different pIs of 4.0 and 4.5 during isoelectric focusing, and each of these components separated into three spots ranging from 4 to 6 kDa during two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The apparent differences in molecular masses or pIs of these isoforms were not due to posttranslational glycosylation. The molecular weight of the purified native protein was determined by applying gel filtration and nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and found to be 24 kDa. ESAT-6 is recognized by the murine monoclonal antibody HYB 76-8, which was used to screen a recombinant lambda gt11 M. tuberculosis DNA library. A phage expressing a gene product recognized by HYB 76-8 was isolated, and a 1.7-kbp fragment of the mycobacterial DNA insert was sequenced. The structural gene of ESAT-6 was identified as the sequence encoding a polypeptide of 95 amino acids. The N terminus of the deduced sequence could be aligned with the 10 amino-terminal amino acids derived from sequence analyses of the native protein. N-terminal sequence analysis showed that the purified antigen was essentially free from contaminants, and the amino acid analysis of the antigen was in good agreement with the DNA sequence-deduced amino acid composition. Thus, the heterogeneities observed in the pI and molecular weight of the purified antigen do not derive from contaminating proteins but are most likely due to heterogeneity of the antigen itself. Native and recombinant ESAT-6 are immunologically active in that both elicited a high release of gamma interferon from T cells isolated from memory-immune mice challenged with M. tuberculosis. Analyses of subcellular fractions of M. tuberculosis showed the presence of ESAT-6 in cytosol- and cell wall-containing fractions. Interspecies analyses showed the presence of ESAT-6 in filtrates from M. tuberculosis complex species. Among filtrates from mycobacteria not belonging to the M. tuberculosis complex, reactivity was observed in Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium szulgai, and Mycobacterium marinum.",1995
s134264,"dna sequencing of the gene encoding a bacterial superantigen, yersinia pseudotuberculosis-derived mitogen (ypm), and characterization of the gene product, cloned ypm.","dna sequencing of the gene encoding a bacterial superantigen, yersinia pseudotuberculosis-derived mitogen (ypm), and characterization of the gene product, cloned ypm.. Previously, we found a novel bacterial superantigen from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, designated Y. pseudotuberculosis-derived mitogen (YPM). In the present study, we analyzed the DNA sequence of the gene encoding YPM. The YPM gene was cloned into a plasmid vector pMW119 and expressed in Escherichia coli DH10B. Like the native YPM, the cloned YPM required the expression of MHC class II molecules on accessory cells in the induction of IL-2 production by human T cells. TCR-V beta repertoire of human T cells reactive with the cloned YPM was V beta 3, V beta 9, V beta 13.1, and V beta 13.2. This repertoire is the same as that of T cells reactive with the native YPM. These results indicate that the cloned YPM expressed in E. coli is identical to the native YPM. Sequencing of the YPM gene revealed that the gene contained an open reading frame of 456 base pairs encoding a precursor form of 151 amino acid residues with m.w. 16,679 that is processed into a mature form of 131 amino acid residues with m.w. 14,529. Homology analysis revealed that the homology of amino acid sequence is quite low among YPM and other well known bacterial superantigens. We designated the gene encoding YPM as ypm.",1995
s134333,recombinant listeria monocytogenes as a live vaccine vehicle for the induction of protective anti-viral cell-mediated immunity.,"recombinant listeria monocytogenes as a live vaccine vehicle for the induction of protective anti-viral cell-mediated immunity.. Listeria monocytogenes (LM) is a Gram-positive bacterium that is able to enter host cells, escape from the endocytic vesicle, multiply within the cytoplasm, and spread directly from cell to cell without encountering the extracellular milieu. The ability of LM to gain access to the host cell cytosol allows proteins secreted by the bacterium to efficiently enter the pathway for major histocompatibility complex class I antigen processing and presentation. We have established a genetic system for expression and secretion of foreign antigens by recombinant strains, based on stable site-specific integration of expression cassettes into the LM genome. The ability of LM recombinants to induce protective immunity against a heterologous pathogen was demonstrated with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). LM strains expressing the entire LCMV nucleoprotein or an H-2Ld-restricted nucleoprotein epitope (aa 118-126) were constructed. Immunization of mice with LM vaccine strains conferred protection against challenge with virulent strains of LCMV that otherwise establish chronic infection in naive adult mice. In vivo depletion of CD8+ T cells from vaccinated mice abrogated their ability to clear viral infection, showing that protective anti-viral immunity was due to CD8+ T cells.",1995
s134347,oral immunization with a recombinant bacterial antigen produced in transgenic plants.,"oral immunization with a recombinant bacterial antigen produced in transgenic plants.. The binding subunit of Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (LT-B) is a highly active oral immunogen. Transgenic tobacco and potato plants were made with the use of genes encoding LT-B or an LT-B fusion protein with a microsomal retention sequence. The plants expressed the foreign peptides, both of which formed oligomers that bound the natural ligand. Mice immunized by gavage produced serum and gut mucosal anti-LT-B immunoglobulins that neutralized the enterotoxin in cell protection assays. Feeding mice fresh transgenic potato tubers also caused oral immunization.",1995
s134544,the sequencing of the 80-kda d15 protective surface antigen of haemophilus influenzae.,"the sequencing of the 80-kda d15 protective surface antigen of haemophilus influenzae.. The 80-kDa D15 antigen (D-15-Ag) has previously been shown to be a target for protective immunity and conserved amongst typeable and nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae. Here, the gene encoding D-15-Ag is shown to encode a 797-aa polypeptide which, after cleavage of the predicted signal peptide, would have a molecular mass of 85,632 Da.",1995
s135080,recombinant 46-kilodalton surface antigen (p46) of mycoplasma hyopneumoniae expressed in escherichia coli can be used for early specific diagnosis of mycoplasmal pneumonia of swine by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.,"recombinant 46-kilodalton surface antigen (p46) of mycoplasma hyopneumoniae expressed in escherichia coli can be used for early specific diagnosis of mycoplasmal pneumonia of swine by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.. The 46-kDa surface antigen (P46) is the early and species-specific immunogenic protein of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae. Three TGA codons encoding tryptophan in the P46 gene were replaced with TGG by an in vitro mutagenesis technique. The mutated P46 gene was expressed in Escherichia coli by using the chelating peptide tag system. The purified recombinant P46 was successfully used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of antibodies against M. hyopneumoniae in swine serum. It did not cross-react with sera from swine infected with Mycoplasma flocculate, Mycoplasma hyorhinis, or Mycoplasma hyosynoviae. With this method, mycoplasmal pneumonia of swine was detectable within 2 weeks after infection.",1995
s135084,naive cd28-deficient t cells can initiate but not sustain an in vitro antigen-specific immune response.,"naive cd28-deficient t cells can initiate but not sustain an in vitro antigen-specific immune response.. Naive T cells require an Ag-specific signal, as well as a costimulatory signal to mount a primary Ag-specific response. Because of their low precursor frequency, it has been difficult to study costimulatory requirements of these Ag-specific T cells. We have generated a CD28-deficient mouse that has been bred to a TCR transgenic (Tg) mouse to better study the function of CD28 during CD4+ T cell responses to Ag. In the absence of CD28, naive TCR Tg T cells responded vigorously to peptide, but responded poorly to mitogen activation. Comparison of activation-induced cell-surface molecules, including CD25, CD44, CD69, and CD71, showed no significant differences between CD28+ and CD28- TCR Tg T cells during the first 24 to 48 h after Ag stimulation. Despite relatively normal surface phenotype and normal proliferative response to Ag, CD28- T cells produced little IL-2, had a decreased sensitivity to lower Ag concentrations, and were unable to maintain their proliferative response. These results suggest that naive T cells are able to utilize other costimulatory signals to initiate a primary Ag-specific response, but require CD28 for optimal, sustained proliferation.",1995
s135086,cloning of a new gene encoding an antigen recognized by melanoma-specific hla-a24-restricted tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.,"cloning of a new gene encoding an antigen recognized by melanoma-specific hla-a24-restricted tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.. The role of tumor-specific T cells in mediating the regression of metastatic melanoma has been suggested by the clinical response of patients to treatment with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). A number of Ags recognized by class I-restricted melanoma-specific T cells have recently been isolated, raising the hope that this will lead to the development of improved therapies. In this study, we report the cloning of a tumor Ag recognized by T cells from melanoma patient 888. Previously, we reported that TIL 888, grown from the tumor of this patient, recognized tyrosinase in an HLA-A24-restricted fashion. This line, when infused into the autologous patient, resulted in complete regression of multiple metastases. Three years later, a second TIL line, TIL 1290, was isolated from a recurrent pelvic tumor. Infusion of a mixture of TIL 888 and TIL 1290 cell lines into the patient resulted in complete regression of a residual abdominal mass and the patient remains disease-free 2 yr later. The TIL 1290 cell line, which recognized melanoma in an HLA-A24-restricted manner, failed to recognize tyrosinase. TIL 1290 was then used to screen an 888 melanoma cDNA library, and an Ag was isolated that did not correspond to any found in sequence databases. This gene, termed p15, was found to be expressed in a variety of normal tissues, and a peptide epitope recognized by TIL 1290 was found to represent the product of an nonmutated gene. Screening of additional cDNA pools resulted in the isolation of a second clone which stimulated TIL 1290. This clone also appeared to represent a transcript of the p15 gene, indicating that this gene may encode the predominant Ag recognized by TIL 1290.",1995
s135249,synthesis and secretion of bacterial antigens by attenuated salmonella via the escherichia coli hemolysin secretion system.,"synthesis and secretion of bacterial antigens by attenuated salmonella via the escherichia coli hemolysin secretion system.. We describe a plasmid system which allows the secretion of foreign antigens in attenuated Salmonella aroA strains by the secretion apparatus of E. coli hemolysin. The gene (or gene fragment) encoding the antigen is inserted in frame into a residual position of the hlyA gene, encoding the HlyA secretion signal (HlyAs). Generally, the fused gene is efficiently expressed and the synthesized antigen is in part secreted into the culture supernatant and in part exposed on the surface of the producing Salmonella strain. The successful use of this approach is demonstrated with two antigens of Salmonella typhimurium, PagC and SlyA, both of which are potent virulence factors but produced only in small amounts under in vitro culture conditions and two virulence proteins of Listeria monocytogenes, p60 and listeriolysin. Interestingly the listeriolysin fusion protein proved to be cytolytically active and allowed, when expressed in Salmonella, the escape of these bacteria into the cytoplasm of infected macrophages.",1994
s135544,safety and immunogenicity study of the auxotrophic shigella flexneri 2a vaccine sfl1070 with a deleted arod gene in adult swedish volunteers.,"safety and immunogenicity study of the auxotrophic shigella flexneri 2a vaccine sfl1070 with a deleted arod gene in adult swedish volunteers.. The live auxotrophic Shigella flexneri 2a vaccine strain SFL1070 with a deleted aroD gene was given orally to 37 adult Swedish volunteers who received three doses within 5 days. Each dose comprised 1 x 10(5) (n = 9), 1 x 10(7) (n = 10), 1 x 10(8) (n = 9) or 1 x 10(9) (n = 9) c.f.u. S. flexneri SFL1070. One volunteer vaccinated with 1 x 10(7) and three vaccinated with 1 x 10(8) c.f.u. reported mild gastrointestinal symptoms after the first dose. Vaccination with 1 x 10(9) c.f.u. caused abdominal pain and watery diarrhoea in four volunteers who all recovered spontaneously within 72 h. S. flexneri SFL1070 was not recovered from volunteers given 1 x 10(5) c.f.u., but was shed in faeces by six volunteers vaccinated with 1 x 10(7), by all nine vaccinated with 1 x 10(8), and by seven volunteers vaccinated with 1 x 10(9) c.f.u. The mean excretion time was 2.6 (range 0-4) days in the 1 x 10(8) and the 1 x 10(9) groups. Serum antibody responses against either S. flexneri 2a and Y lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) or Shigella invasion plasmid antigens (Ipa) were seen in eight volunteers vaccinated with 1 x 10(9) (p < 0.01 to p < 0.05 for mean relative titres of IgA and IgG against S. flexneri 2a and Y LPSs), in four vaccinated with 1 x 10(8), and in two and one volunteers each vaccinated with 1 x 10(7) and 1 x 10(5) c.f.u. of S. flexneri SFL1070. Intestinal sIgA responses to the same antigens were elicited in all volunteers in the 1 x 10(9) and the 1 x 10(8) groups, and in six and one volunteers vaccinated with 1 x 10(7) and 1 x 10(5) c.f.u., respectively. The sIgA responses against S. flexneri 2a and Y LPSs were significant in all but the 1 x 10(5) group (p < 0.01 to p < 0.05). Significant antibody-secreting cell (ASC) responses specific to S. flexneri 2a LPS were seen in peripheral blood from eight volunteers each in the 1 x 10(9) and 1 x 10(8) groups and from five volunteers vaccinated with 1 x 10(7) c.f.u. (p < 0.01 to p < 0.05). The number of volunteers showing anti-Shigella Ipa ASC responses in these groups were five (p < 0.01 to p < 0.05), three and one, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1995
s135759,use of salmonella for heterologous gene expression and vaccine delivery systems.,"use of salmonella for heterologous gene expression and vaccine delivery systems.. In the past year, the importance of secretory IgA has been emphasized as fundamental to protection against oral Salmonella infection. In several human trials, aro mutants of Salmonella typhi were highly immunogenic, but still retained the capacity to proceed beyond the gut wall after ingestion. Epitopes of Shiga toxin and influenza hemagglutinin have been expressed in Salmonella surface proteins in work aimed at the construction of hybrid vaccines. Eukaryotic cell involvement in the process of Salmonella attachment/invasion appears to be triggered by host cell phospholipase activation. Our understanding of the number and functions of Salmonella genes involved in the attachment/invasion process has increased considerably--different gene sets are required for invasion of different cell types.",1993
s135768,large-scale production of vibrio cholerae toxin b subunit for use in oral vaccines.,"large-scale production of vibrio cholerae toxin b subunit for use in oral vaccines.. By systematically manipulating promoter and ribosome binding structures, plasmid copy number and the structure of the cholera toxin B (CTB) subunit gene, we were able to develop a plasmid expression system that, when used in conjunction with an optimized growth medium, provided yields of CTB approaching one gram per liter. The CTB protein which was secreted to > 95%, could readily be purified from the growth medium of a V. cholerae production strain and was shown to be immunologically indistinguishable from previously used vaccine preparations of native or recombinant CTB.",1993
s135885,the tularaemia vaccine.,"the tularaemia vaccine.. Tularaemia is a disease caused by the facultative intracellular bacterium Francisella tularensis. Vaccination resulting in protective immunity is induced by live vaccine only. Such vaccination can be performed by scarification utilizing the live vaccine strain of F. tularensis (F. tularensis LVS), which results in good but not complete protection. Humoral as well as cell-mediated immunity are induced by vaccination and it has been shown that cell-mediated immunity is a prerequisite for protection. Since the live vaccine strain is attenuated and the genetic background of attenuation is unknown it is important to consider process parameters so that the immunogenicity of the vaccine is preserved.",1994
s135932,a prototype recombinant vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus type 3.,"a prototype recombinant vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus type 3.. We have produced a genetically-engineered chimeric protein composed of the external domains of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion (F) protein and the parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV-3) hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system. The yield of the soluble chimeric FRSV-HNPIV-3 protein could be increased approximately 2-fold by using Trichoplasia ni (High Five) insect cells in place of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) for expression. The chimeric protein, purified from the supernatant of baculovirus-infected High Five cells by immunoaffinity chromatography was correctly processed at the F2-F1 proteolytic cleavage site. Immunochemical analysis of the chimera with a panel of anti-F and anti-HN monoclonal antibodies suggested that the antigenicity of the major F and HN neutralization epitopes of the chimeric protein was preserved. Immunization of cotton rats with two 1 or 10 micrograms doses of the chimeric protein adsorbed to aluminum phosphate elicited strong PIV-3 specific HAI responses as well as PIV-3 and RSV specific neutralizing antibodies, and at either dose completely protected against challenge with live RSV and PIV-3.",1994
s136015,unravelling the pathogenic role of helicobacter pylori in peptic ulcer: potential new therapies and vaccines.,"unravelling the pathogenic role of helicobacter pylori in peptic ulcer: potential new therapies and vaccines.. The recognition that peptic ulcer is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Helicobacter pylori has revolutionized the approach to diagnosis and therapy of this condition. Treatment of the symptoms of peptic ulcer with drugs that block acid secretion is already being replaced by antibiotic eradication of the causative agent. Studies of the molecular events that lead to H. pylori pathogenesis have shown that clinical isolates can be divided into two groups, only one of which produces a cytotoxin and is associated with severe disease. The cloning of the genes coding for molecules specific for disease-associated strains of H. pylori, and the development of animal models that mimic the human pathology, will provide the basis for better strategies to treat and prevent peptic-ulcer disease.",1994
s136486,sv40 t antigen directed by a powerful erythroid enhancer-promoter produced sarcomas and pancreatic tumors but not erythroid-specific tumors in transgenic mice.,"sv40 t antigen directed by a powerful erythroid enhancer-promoter produced sarcomas and pancreatic tumors but not erythroid-specific tumors in transgenic mice.. We have expressed the simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen oncogene in erythroid tissues of mice to test its ability to immortilize erythroid cells. A transgene construct was built in which the SV40 large T antigen structural gene was linked to erythroid-specific enhancer and promoter sequences. The enhancer employed was the human beta-globin family microlocus control region, and the promoter sequences were derived from the human beta-globin promoter. Transgenic mice were generated and they expressed T antigen in the bone marrow and spleen cells. Yet, no hematopoietic neoplasia arose in these mice. Instead, after a lag period of 2-6 months, the mice developed soft tissue sarcomas and pancreatic islet-cell tumors that expressed high levels of T antigen.",1994
s136613,restoration of endogenous antigen processing in burkitt's lymphoma cells by epstein-barr virus latent membrane protein-1: coordinate up-regulation of peptide transporters and hla-class i antigen expression.,"restoration of endogenous antigen processing in burkitt's lymphoma cells by epstein-barr virus latent membrane protein-1: coordinate up-regulation of peptide transporters and hla-class i antigen expression.. Group I Burkitt lymphoma (BL) lines retaining the original BL tumor cell phenotype are unable to present endogenously expressed antigens to HLA class I-restricted cytotoxic T cells (CTL) but can be recognized if the relevant HLA class I/peptide epitope complex is reconstituted at the cell surface by exogenous addition of synthetic target peptide. Endogenous antigen-processing function is restored in BL lines that have undergone Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced drift in culture to the group III phenotype typically displayed by EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) of normal B cell origin. We compared group I versus group III cells for their expression of proteasome components, transporter proteins and HLA-class I antigens, all of which are thought to be involved in the endogenous antigen processing pathway. By Western blot analysis, there were not consistent differences in the low molecular mass protein subunits of proteasomes (lmp)-2, lmp-7 and delta, although the mb-1 proteasome subunit was regularly present at higher levels in group I BL lines relative to group III lines or LCL. By contrast there were marked differences in the expression of peptide transporter-associated proteins (Tap), with down-regulation of Tap-1 and Tap-2 in 8/8 and 7/8 group I BL lines, respectively. Surface levels of HLA class I antigens were also consistently lower in group I cells; this was not associated with an intracellular accumulation of free HLA heavy chains, such as is seen in the Tap-deficient T2 processing-mutant line, but instead reflected a reduced rate of HLA class I synthesis in group I cells. Analysis of EBV gene transfectants of the B lymphoma lines BJAB and BL41 showed that the virus-encoded latent membrane protein-1 (LMP1), which is one of several EBV antigens expressed in group III but not in group I cells, was uniquely able to up-regulate expression both of the Tap proteins and HLA class I. Furthermore, this was accompanied by a restoration of antigen-processing function as measured by the ability of these cells to present an endogenously expressed viral antigen to CTL. These effects of LMP1 were similar to those induced in the same cell lines by interferon-gamma treatment. The results implicate both Tap and HLA class I expression as factors limiting the antigen-processing function of BL cells, and suggest that the accessibility of other EBV-associated malignancies to CTL surveillance may be critically dependent upon their LMP1 status.",1995
